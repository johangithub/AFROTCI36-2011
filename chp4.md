#### 4.1.{#4_1} General Information.

##### 4.1.1.{#4_1_1} This section provides eligibility and application requirements for AFROTC cadets. It covers entrance and eligibility requirements common to both the General Military Course (GMC) and the Professional Officer Course (POC). The OPR for this chapter is AFROTC/RRF.

##### 4.1.2.{#4_1_2} Detachment personnel should be recruiting the best and brightest for the AF based on all AFROTC standards.

Although this chapter outlines the minimum standards for AFROTC membership, Detachment Commanders have the authority to set higher standards to accommodate limited detachment resources at their schools. Meeting minimum qualifications does not necessarily justify keeping a cadet in AFROTC or supporting the cadet for an EA. Just because someone may meet the minimum standards does not necessarily mean they should be accepted for commission through AFROTC. For example, an applicant that has a CGPA of 2.5 during his sophomore year is less likely to compete well in PSP or complete the academic requirements outlined for AFROTC cadets. It may be prudent to dismiss these cadets sooner rather than providing false hope when historical data shows they will not complete the program. Another example is PFA scores. Some Detachment Commanders have set a higher PFA standard than the minimum to qualify for submission for an EA since PFA scores can decrease by several points during summer FT at Maxwell AFB.

#### 4.2.{#4_2} General Membership Eligibility.

##### 4.2.1.{#4_2_1} The core competency of AFROTC is to recruit and train individuals working on their first undergraduate degree. Individuals with a previously completed undergraduate or graduate degree are expected to pursue an AF commission through OTS.

##### 4.2.2.{#4_2_2} Cadets who complete their undergraduate degree before completing AFROTC are authorized to take graduate courses as long as the period of the graduate work does not exceed 50 percent of their time in the POC.

+ 4.2.2.1. Cadets cannot apply scholarship funds towards graduate level coursework without express AFROTC/RRFP approval via an AFROTC Form 22 package. These waivers will be the exception and only for hard-to-fill academic majors.

+ 4.2.2.2. Without prior approval, scholarship funding must terminate once the original undergraduate degree is completed.

+ 4.2.2.3. Counsel these cadets via AFROTC Form 16 that there is no guarantee that they will finish a graduate degree. They will commission as soon as AS classes and FT are completed.

##### 4.2.3.{#4_2_3} Students seeking to enter AFROTC to complete a second undergraduate degree or a graduate degree must have approval from AFROTC/RR for program entry.

Major considerations for approval by AFROTC/RR will be majoring in critical technical majors identified on the restricted website, O&D criteria (reference Figure 4.1) and 3.0 CGPA. AFROTC will not accept any applicant who has already completed a graduate degree. Cadets entering AFROTC with a previous degree are not eligible for scholarship monies unless they are pursuing a hard-to-fill accession degree requirement as determined by HQ AFROTC/RR. Funding for these degrees must be approved by AFROTC/RRF via an AFROTC Form 22 package.

##### 4.2.4.{#4_2_4} Each individual must:

+ 4.2.4.1. Be a full-time undergraduate student enrolled at an accredited college that hosts an AFROTC Detachment or a university or junior college having a cross-town agreement or consortium arrangement established according to HOLMCENTERI 36- 2014, AFROTC Enrollment and Relations with Host/Non-Host Institutions, Including Crosstown and Consortium Agreements.

+ 4.2.4.2. Participate in both AS classes and LLAB while enrolled in school to be considered a GMC or POC member. Completed GMC and POC members will participate in AFROTC activities as determined by the Detachment Commander.

+ 4.2.4.3. Be age 14 or older (Reference paragraph 4.4. for maximum age limits).

##### 4.2.5.{#4_2_5} GPA Requirements.

All previous college coursework attempted must be used to calculate the ROTC CGPA. Cadets must have a CGPA of 2.0 or greater to join AFROTC. Reference Attachment 12 for GPA minimums for contracting, scholarship nomination and activation, and the POC Selection Process (PSP).

##### 4.2.6.{#4_2_6} Family members or relatives of AFROTC cadre are not allowed to enroll at the detachment where the cadre member is assigned.

----

#### 4.3.{#4_3} Application Records.

##### 4.3.1.{#4_3_1} The detachment will establish a cadet Unit Personnel Record Group (UPRG) folder to maintain forms and other records. File the documents in the following sections: Section I, Guidance Records, Correspondence, and Orders; Section II, Evaluation Instruments; Section III, Records of Membership; and Section IV, Medical.

NOTE 1: Students enrolled in the AS class and taking the course for credit only are required to have a WINGS record created and are not required to complete an AFROTC Form 20, Application for AFROTC Membership. Enrollment in both the AS class and LLAB implies an intent to commission and as such warrants the establishment of an application/WINGS record.

NOTE 2: Non-scholarship GMC applicants are required to complete, and the detachment is required to maintain (at a minimum), the AFROTC Forms 20 and 35, Sports Physical (if no qualified medical examination), the AF Form 2030, the DD Form 2005, the Request and Consent for Release of Student Records and the Drug Demand Reduction MOU. Cadets will remain in "Applicant" status in WINGS until all enrollment paperwork is complete and appropriate waivers are obtained. Upon completion of all enrollment paperwork and securing of all required waivers, cadets can be placed in "Active" status in WINGS. All enrollment documentation must be completed prior to scholarship nomination or prior to PSP nomination (whichever occurs first).

##### 4.3.2.{#4_3_2} Each applicant will complete the following:

+ 4.3.2.1. AFROTC Form 20, Application for AFROTC Membership, used to screen applicants for membership into AFROTC. After the AFROTC Form 20 is complete, update the cadet's information into WINGS.

+ 4.3.2.2. AFROTC Form 35, Certification of Involvements with Civil, Military, or School Authorities/Law Enforcement Officials, is used to document civil involvements and counseling of cadets who have civil involvements. Detachments must still accomplish the AFROTC Form 35 for recertification on the day of and prior to enlistment (reference chapter 4.5.3). For HSSP winners, the AFROTC Form 35 from the HSSP interview will be placed in the UPRG with the new Form 35. It does not replace the requirement to accomplish a Form 35 during application or enlistment.

NOTE: For all cadets in the enlisted commissioning programs, the AF Form 56, Application & Evaluation for Training Leading to a Commission in the United States Air Force, will replace the AFROTC Form 20. Cadets will still need to complete the AFROTC Form 35, Certification of Involvements with Civil, Military, or School Authorities/Law Enforcement Officials, HQ AFROTC will forward the AF Form 56 to detachments for filing in the UPRG.

+ 4.3.2.3. DD Form 93, Record of Emergency Data.

+ 4.3.2.4. AFROTC Form 500, Restrictions on Personal Conduct in the Armed Forces, is used to provide cadets with policy on personal conduct.

+ 4.3.2.5. Request and Consent for Release of Student Records (Attachment .

+ 4.3.2.6. DD Form 2005, Privacy Act Statement – Health Care Records (2 copies; one for applicant and one for record).

+ 4.3.2.7. AF Form 2030, USAF Drug and Alcohol Abuse Certificate [not required for Scholarships for Outstanding Airmen to ROTC (SOAR), Airmen Scholarship Commissioning Program (ASCP), and POC Early Release Program (POC-ERP); reference AFI 36-2013, Officer Training School (OTS) and Enlisted Commissioning Programs (ECPS)].

+ 4.3.2.8. AF Form 3010, USAF Statement of Understanding for Dependent Care Responsibility.

+ 4.3.2.9. Air Force Dependency Policy Statement of Understanding (Attachment 14).

+ 4.3.2.10. Detachment personnel must verify US citizenship by reviewing the original and filing a copy of the birth or naturalization certificate (if applicable). Cadets must also reveal whether they are dual citizens. Annotate on the copy "verified with original document" and date/sign the file copy.

+ 4.3.2.11. Social Security Card. Annotate on the copy "verified with original document" and date/sign the file copy.

+ 4.3.2.12. Drug Demand Reduction Program (DDRP) MOU (Attachment 11). NOTE: When contracting and new student orientation occur on the same day, the AF Form 1056, AFROTC Contract, is the source document for the DDRP and the MOU is not required.

+ 4.3.2.13. DD Form 2983, Recruit/Trainee Prohibited Activities Acknowledgment.

##### 4.3.3.{#4_3_3} Completed by Detachment personnel: AFROTC Form 26, AFROTC Cadet Record Inventory Section 1 – 4, is used to inventory applicable administrative documents. AFROTC Form 63, AFROTC Enrollment / Enlistment Checklist, is used to document AFROTC membership eligibility.

##### 4.3.4.{#4_3_4} Initiate a new record for previously disenrolled cadets when there is a break in participation. Retain the original UPRG, for one year. If a cadet returns to AFROTC program and meets all eligibility criteria for entry, re-accomplish the following forms: AF Form 2030, AF Form 3010, AFROTC Form 500, AFROTC Form 63.

----

#### 4.4.{#4_4} Age.

##### 4.4.1.{#4_4_1} Reference AFI 36-2005, Appointment in Commissioned Grades and Designation and Assignment in Professional Categories – Reserve of the Air Force and United States Air Force.

##### 4.4.2.{#4_4_2} Minimum age for:

+ 4.4.2.1. Program entry is 14.

+ 4.4.2.2. Enlistment is 17.

+ 4.4.2.3. Commissioning is 18.

##### 4.4.3.{#4_4_3} Maximum age limits:

+ 4.4.3.1. Cadets in a rated category must commission before their 29th birthday to allow AFPC time to schedule appropriate training class prior to age 30 (a cadet normally enters into training 8-12 months after commissioning). Age restriction for rated duty is not waiverable.

+ 4.4.3.2. Non-rated cadets must commission by age 31 (up to age 35 with waiver).

##### 4.4.4.{#4_4_4} When submitting cadets for enrollment allocations, ensure that they will meet the age limits IAW paragraphs 4.4.1 and/or 4.4.2.

##### 4.4.5.{#4_4_5} Age waivers non-rated are restricted to high quality cadets.

Detachment Commanders may waive the maximum age restriction for applicants who meet one of the academic Outstanding and Deserving (O&D) criteria (see Figure 4.1) and can be commissioned prior to age 34. Submit a WINGS trouble ticket for waiver updates within Detachment Commander authority. HQ AFROTC/RRF may waive those applicants who do not meet the O&D criteria and can be commissioned prior to age 34, however waivers will only be approved for exceptional candidates. Submit age waiver requests via AFROTC Form 22.

+ 4.4.5.1. HQ AFPC may waive the maximum age restriction for individuals scheduled to commission after age 34 but prior to age 35 (commissioning only). Title 10 USC, Section 8355 prohibits commissioning or active duty entrance after age 35, except for nurses, who can commission up to age 42.

#### 4.5.{#4_5} Adverse Involvements with Civil, Military, or School Authorities.

##### 4.5.1.{#4_5_1} Officer candidates must be morally and financially sound. When there are questions concerning an applicant's suitability, the Detachment Commander may consider waiver of the prior unsuitable incident or request a waiver through AFROTC/RRF IAW the guidance below. The procedures and documents listed below will facilitate administrative processing of involvements and provide tools for evaluating character traits for officer candidates. AFROTC cadets are not subject to UCMJ jurisdiction, therefore Article 31 of the UCMJ does not apply nor does the constitutional prohibition against compelled self-incrimination for the purpose of entry into the program. AFROTC cadets will continue to use the AFROTC Form 35 and AFROTC Form 4.

##### 4.5.2.{#4_5_2} Civil Involvement Guidance for AFIT, AECP, and NECP students.

AFIT, AECP and NECP students are not cadets. They are active duty members and fall under UCMJ authority. Under Article 31, UCMJ, compulsory self-incrimination is prohibited. No military member may interrogate, or request any statement from a person suspected of an offense unless the suspect is advised of their Article 31 rights and waives those rights. Investigative actions for AECP and NECP students will mirror those for any other active duty member. They may not be required to report civil involvements on an AFROTC Form 35, Certification of Involvements with Civil, Military, or School Authorities/Law Enforcement Officials, and AFROTC Form 4, Affidavit Civil Involvement, because such reporting requirements violate Article 31, UCMJ. Although they fall under UCMJ authority, they can be dismissed from the AECP/NECP program for failing to meet academic requirements, active duty requirements or commissioning standards.

##### 4.5.3.{#4_5_3} The AFROTC Form 35 is the basic document used to record cadet civil involvements.

+ 4.5.3.1. Upon application to AFROTC, the Detachment Commander or their designated representative must initially counsel applicants that they are required to report all involvements with civil, military or school authorities, regardless of the severity, disposition, or the date of the involvement. If doubt exists as to the need to list an involvement, it must be listed to preclude future question regarding omissions.

+ 4.5.3.2. Any offense, violation of law or ordinance, or any other incident causing adverse involvement or contact with civil, military, or school authorities as an adult or juvenile is an involvement for AFROTC purposes and must be reported. This includes violations of school honor code; prior-service UCMJ/Article 15 actions; and administrative discharge, demotion, or letters of reprimand while in government or military service. Any adverse involvement affecting a cadet or an applicant for membership in AFROTC, regardless of the outcome or date of the offense, must be considered under this section to determine whether the involvement disqualifies the applicant for enlistment or continuation in the AFROTC program. Once initially certified, the individual's AFROTC Form 35 becomes a permanent record; do not alter or re-accomplish it for any reason. Subsequent involvements must be added to the original AFROTC Form 35. Add additional AFROTC Forms 35 as needed.

+ 4.5.3.3. Cadets must report all involvements regardless of final disposition. When a single incident results in more than one offense, consider each charge a separate involvement and list on the AFROTC Form 35 as a separate entry. A finding of not guilty or advice by an attorney or court official to consider the record as clear does not constitute authority to omit the involvement from the AFROTC Form 35. This includes involvements that resulted in state-sealed records or expungement relief with respect to juvenile records.

	+ 4.5.3.3.1. When listing events on the AFROTC Form 35, have cadets provide details to show the significance of the event. For example, when listing speeding, the cadet MUST indicate the speed he/she was traveling and the speed limit. This gives the Detachment Commander and reviewing authorities a clear picture of the cadet's behavior.

+ 4.5.3.4. The Detachment Commander must sign all AFROTC Forms 35 that list civil involvements.

	+ 4.5.3.4.1. A completed AFROTC Form 35 without ANY involvements listed does NOT require the Detachment Commander's signature. In this instance, any cadre member may sign the AFROTC Form 35.

##### 4.5.4.{#4_5_4} Brief the cadet that they must continue to report all subsequent civil involvements to the detachment within 72 hours after the initial involvement occurs. For involvements that occur during school break periods of more than 72 hours, the individual may wait to report the involvement NLT 72 hours after their return to classes following the break. NOTE: The disposition information must be updated within 72 hours of final disposition.

+ 4.5.4.1. Late reporting of civil involvements, when voluntarily reported by the cadet, does not constitute "failure to report." Detachment Commanders may award a CE for failure to report within the 72 hour timeframe; however failure to report within 7 days is considered excessively late and should result in a CE. Have the individual enter the involvement on the AFROTC Form 35 and prepare an AFROTC Form 4, describing the incident and the reason it was not reported if an individual fails to report an involvement within the required timeframe due to an "honest" oversight. Attach the AFROTC Form 4 to the AFROTC Form 35. NOTE: AFROTC/RRF waiver approval for the underlying civil involvement is only required if the conduct is not within the Detachment/CC's waiver authority (reference Table 4.2).

	+ 4.5.4.1.1. If the failure to report the incident was an effort to minimize the impact of the civil involvement by showing the reduced charge obtained through a plea bargain or other court action, consider this a failure to report and issue a CE for failure to report in a timely manner and counsel the cadet via the AFROTC Form 16. Have the cadet complete the AFROTC Form 35 and prepare an AFROTC Form 4, describing the incident and the reason it was not reported.

	+ 4.5.4.1.2. The Detachment Commander can initiate a disenrollment investigation if he/she believes the failure to report the involvement in this case constitutes an integrity violation or is a culmination of other failures to meet military retention standards.

+ 4.5.4.2. If a cadet failed to report an involvement in an effort to deceive detachment personnel, this is considered an integrity violation, and the cadet must be investigated for disenrollment. Have the cadet enter the involvement on the AFROTC Form 35. If the cadet is a non-contract cadet, have the cadet prepare an AFROTC Form 4. A contract cadet will have the opportunity to provide a statement during the disenrollment investigation process.

##### 4.5.5.{#4_5_5} AFROTC Form 4, Affidavit Civil Involvement.

When required, the individual must prepare an AFROTC Form 4 based on the involvement originally cited by the law enforcement agency, not the lesser offense, if the charge is reduced. AFROTC Form 4 is used to get an account of the what, when, how and where of any civil involvement. Multiple involvements may be explained in a single affidavit; however, each separate charge must be clearly addressed. Affidavits must be subscribed and sworn to before a detachment officer or another official authorized to administer oaths and filed in the cadet's UPRG. Affidavits are required to explain any involvement listed in Attachment 13, Category 4 or any civil involvement that requires an AFROTC/RRF waiver.

+ 4.5.5.1. For alcohol-related incidents, the AFROTC Form 4 must include the amount consumed, over what period of time, the time between last consumption and the civil involvement, field sobriety test results, blood alcohol content, breathalyzer results, etc.

+ 4.5.5.2. For drug-related incidents, the AFROTC Form 4 must include dates and circumstances surrounding each occurrence, total number of times used, specific drug or combination of drugs used, effects produced, and a description of any residual effects.

##### 4.5.6.{#4_5_6} Corroboration and AFROTC Form 14, Law Enforcement Inquiry. The cadet must give express, written consent for all necessary corroboration for civil involvements of cadet applicants. The AFROTC Form 14 supports this purpose.

+ 4.5.6.1. Corroboration of Involvements. Obtain statements from civil, military, or school authorities describing the officially recorded facts and disposition using the AFROTC Form 14. Follow up by tracer, letter, or telephone conversation if statements are not made available in response to initial written requests. Place initial requests and all records of follow-up action in the cadet's UPRG. If corroboration is not available and a waiver is required, the cadet's statement will be used in lieu of corroboration. If the laws of the state where the involvement occurred prohibit the release of corroboration and the reply from the local authorities to the corroboration request states the specific law, make an entry in the remarks section of the AFROTC Form 35 citing the appropriate authority (e.g. ARS 1127).

+ 4.5.6.2. Record of Corroboration. Corroboration must be obtained through police authorities. If this is not possible, obtain a certified copy of the court records whenever a police agency refuses to corroborate the circumstances surrounding a charge. The court proceedings are a matter of public record and cannot be withheld except in a few cases where a first-offender law is applied.

+ 4.5.6.3. Costs. The cadet is responsible for any expenses associated with obtaining required records. If necessary, the cadet should contact the clerk of the court and request the certified copies, pay all fees, and have the document sent directly to the detachment. In most cases, individuals are able to obtain their own records that have been sealed under a first-offender law. If court records are not available, attach correspondence addressing this situation to the waiver request. Letters from prosecutors or clerks of court explaining disposition of charges are satisfactory. Letters from defense counsel on behalf of the applicant or cadet are not adequate corroboration.

##### 4.5.7.{#4_5_7} If any discrepancy exists between the entries on the individual's AFROTC Form 35, the AFROTC Form 4, and the AFROTC Form 14, allow the individual an opportunity to explain, in writing, before further action is taken. Attach a copy of the individual's explanation to the AFROTC Form 35. If it appears there has been an attempt to conceal the seriousness of an involvement, the Detachment Commander must initiate an investigation for disenrollment (contracted) or dismissal (non-contract).

##### 4.5.8.{#4_5_8} Waiver of Civil Involvement.

+ 4.5.8.1. A total of 10 independent civil involvements, or five independent civil involvements within the previous 18 months, is unacceptable for entry or retention in AFROTC. Additionally, Detachment Commanders should not continue to waive a series of significant involvements of a similar nature. For example, if a cadet continues to receive speeding tickets for clearly excessive speeds that represents willful disregard for the law, retention in AFROTC would not be appropriate since the individual in question has not modified their behavior after counseling.

+ 4.5.8.2. Detachment Commanders have waiver authority for non-criminal involvements and for minor misdemeanor criminal involvements listed in Attachment 13. Any involvements not listed in or not similar in nature to those listed in Attachment 13 must be forwarded to AFROTC/RRF for waiver consideration via AFROTC Form 22. To determine the waiver authority for an adverse involvement, the offense should be characterized as it was charged in the original indictment, complaint, notification, or other charging document, even if a less serious offense is ultimately adjudicated. For example, a DUI charge that is later reduced to Careless Driving may not be waived by the Detachment Commander. Contact Holm Center/JA if in doubt about the misdemeanor or felony classification of a criminal charge. If no charges were filed or the case was dropped, Detachment Commander can waive involvement (category 4 or 5) as long as corroboration was requested and documented.

+ 4.5.8.3. Detachment Commanders should contact HQ AFROTC/RRFP if they have any concerns in interpreting whether or not an involvement is waiverable and if the proposed waiver action is consistent with similar actions across AFROTC.

+ 4.5.8.4. Detachment Commanders may not waive involvements listed in Attachment 13, Category 4, until they have examined any available evidence (including police reports) and/or the court or administrative report. Once corroboration is received, the Detachment Commander can make a determination on whether to grant the waiver. The cadet MUST notify the Detachment Commander once the Category 4 involvement has been resolved. "Resolved" is defined as conviction, acquittal, dismissal of charges, placement into a pretrial diversion program, dismissal after compliance with imposed conditions, or final determination of action by an administrative authority. Once the case is resolved, the Detachment Commander must document that the original waiver decision still stands on the AFROTC Form 35. If the Detachment Commander no longer supports a waiver based on court resolution, initiate a disenrollment investigation (contracted) or dismissal (non-contract). Examples of changes in the original waiver decision can include new information that came out in the final court proceedings, significant court-levied restitution, etc.

+ 4.5.8.5. Detachment Commanders must base their waiver decisions on the original event triggering the civil involvement, not necessarily the adjudicated results of the case. Detachment Commanders must base their decisions on their independent determination of the facts, based upon the evidence available to them. Acquittal, dismissal of charges, nolle prosequi, expunged record or pretrial diversion does not negate the significance of the underlying conduct. Consider the following mitigating circumstances in detachment decisions: immaturity attributable to age at the time of the offense, isolated nature of the conduct, circumstances surrounding the offense, and transitory conditions contributing to the conduct (divorce, serious illness or death in immediate family, etc.).

+ 4.5.8.6. Cadets may not be contracted until all civil involvements have been resolved via the appropriate waiver authority. Except for completion of community service, suspended sentences, and restraint for non-waiverable offenses, a 3-month waiting period is required prior to contracting a cadet following termination or completion of parole, probation (supervised or unsupervised), suspended sentence, or any period of confinement or restraint (legally imposed restrictions, such as confinement, suspended sentence confinement, parole, probation (supervised or unsupervised), work detail, pretrial confinement, restrictions from freedom of movement, periods of imposed community service, or required reporting to probation officer or other official.

+ 4.5.8.7. For all civil involvements which require a waiver from AFROTC/RRF, detachments must obtain corroboration, (e.g., police reports, charging documents indictment, ticket, etc.) and court disposition documents (court record of conviction, dismissal, etc.). See paragraph 4.5.6. above.

+ 4.5.8.8. Cadets pending AFROTC/RRF evaluation for adverse involvements are not eligible for scholarship activation, enlistment, enrollment allocation, FT attendance or commissioning until waivers are approved and the commander signs the AFROTC Form 35.

+ 4.5.8.9. Whenever a waiver of a civil involvement is granted, counsel/document on the AFROTC Form 35. Cadets must initial the counseling statement on the AFROTC Form 35.

----

#### 4.6.{#4_6} Alcohol Use and Abuse.

##### 4.6.1.{#4_6_1} AFROTC enforces a strict alcohol use and abuse policy.

##### 4.6.2.{#4_6_2} Unlawful possession or consumption of alcohol; including Minor in Possession (MIP).

Detachment Commanders may waive ONE incident of unlawful possession or consumption to include "Minor in Possession," or its local equivalent that was the result of a civil involvement for GMC and POC cadets. Waiver for this incident must not involve any other charge, like using a false ID to obtain the alcohol. A CE MUST be issued with the Detachment Commander waiver if the event occurred while the cadet was contracted in the AFROTC program. If the event occurred prior to entry in the program, no CE is warranted but the Detachment Commander can grant the appropriate waiver. The waiver of a pre-AFROTC MIP charge counts toward the one incident waiverable by the Detachment Commander. All waivers must be appropriately documented on the AFROTC Form 35 and the cadet must be counseled via the AFROTC Form 16 that future alcohol- related incidents will result in investigation for disenrollment or dismissal from AFROTC if a waiver is not granted by AFROTC/RRF. (Reference paragraph 4.5.5.1, Attachment 13 and Table 4.2) Cadets (GMC or POC) who self-report a minor in possession that did not result in a civil involvement will receive a CE and stern warning that any future alcohol-related incidents will result in dismissal or investigation for disenrollment; Detachment Commander waiver is also required.

##### 4.6.3.{#4_6_3} All alcohol-related incidents, other than those described in paragraph 4.6.2, require a AFROTC/RRF waiver.

##### 4.6.4.{#4_6_4} Purchase of alcohol for a minor. 

The purchase of alcohol for a minor, supplying alcohol to a minor, or taking no action to stop the supplying of alcohol to a minor in situations under their control (example: hosting party at their house/apartment, bringing alcohol to tailgate and not controlling it thereby allowing minors to obtain alcohol) will require an AFROTC/RRF waiver. Issue a CE and submit waiver request to HQ AFROTC/RRFP. Should the waiver not be approved, non- contract cadets will be released from AFROTC and contract cadets will be investigated for disenrollment.

##### 4.6.5.{#4_6_5} Alcohol Related Incidents.

When considering the severity of any alcohol-related incident, the following circumstances WILL NOT be waived.

+ 4.6.5.1. Excessive Blood Alcohol Content (BAC). AFROTC policy defines excessive BAC as .12 or higher. If the individual refused to submit to a breathalyzer test, BAC level will be based on information provided in the incident report.

+ 4.6.5.2. Incidents where person lost consciousness.

+ 4.6.5.3. Incidents where the individual was hospitalized for medical treatment.

+ 4.6.5.4. Incidents that include violence, resisting arrest, not cooperating with authorities.

+ 4.6.5.5. Incidents that include property damage of any kind or injury to another person.

##### 4.6.6.{#4_6_6} Multiple alcohol-related incidents will be reviewed very closely when considering waiver requests. Multiple events that show an increase in alcohol use/abuse will not be waived. Alcohol incidents prior to coming to AFROTC will be considered in making the waiver decisions for multiple alcohol-related incidents, as well as those occurring while members of AFROTC. For example, if a Detachment Commander has waived a MIP charge and the cadet later receives a DUI, a waiver is not warranted as the cadet has shown poor judgment with respect to alcohol and has not learned from the first event.

##### 4.6.7.{#4_6_7} Detachment Commanders must look closely at the charge, corroboration, and cadet statement.

On a few occasions, authorities may charge an individual with a higher/lesser charge which will not include the charge of an alcohol-related incident. However, when reading the corroboration or student statement the fact that the individual was under the influence of alcohol can be determined. This is considered an alcohol-related incident for AFROTC waiver consideration. List it as such on the AFROTC Form 35. For example, a cadet may be charged with trespassing. This would be the charge initially listed on the A FROT C Form 35. After obtaining corroboration, the police report says the individual was also inebriated. This event is now considered an alcohol- related incident for waiver consideration and must be identified as such on the AFROTC Form 35, even if waiverable by the Detachment Commander.

##### 4.6.8.{#4_6_8} Detachment Commanders may waive only those alcohol-related involvements listed in Attachment 13.

Detachment Commanders may deny waiver consideration or submit waiver requests to AFROTC/RRFA via AFROTC Form 22, as they deem appropriate (reference AF Form 2030, definition of terms section, for a description of alcohol abuse).

##### 4.6.9.{#4_6_9} Voluntarily Reported Alcohol Abuse. Whenever a cadet voluntarily reports chronic alcohol abuse, independent of an involvement that must be recorded on an AFROTC Form 35, determine whether to dismiss (non-contract) or investigate for disenrollment. Do your best to help them with their problem, starting with counseling services available at the university.

##### 4.6.10.{#4_6_10} Independent Evidence of Alcohol Abuse. When evidence of chronic alcohol abuse is brought to the attention of the Detachment Commander by a third party, contact Holm Center/JA for advice on the appropriate course of action based on assessment of evidence and allegations.

#### 4.7.{#4_7} AFROTC Substance Abuse, Hemp Derivative and Drug Demand Reduction Policy.

##### 4.7.1.{#4_7_1} Drug Abuse Orientation. AFI 44-121, Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program, is the basic directive that prescribes the drug abuse policy.

+ 4.7.1.1. The general rule is that applicants are not eligible for service in the Air Force if they have ever used, possessed, manufactured, or distributed any illegal drugs. The Air Force also has a policy that precludes its members from using any hemp derivative. Brief each applicant upon completion of the AFROTC Form 20 on the United States Air Force Drug Abuse Policy. Use the AF Form 2030 to screen applicants and cadets for drug abuse and, as a minimum, explain each item on the AF Form 2030, especially the fact that any future use (also known as post-orientation) is disqualifying (non- waiverable). During the HSSP interview, detachments will use the AF Form 2030 to screen high school scholarship applicants.

+ 4.7.1.2. Ensure the applicant understands the importance of listing required information when completing the AF Form 2030. Revealing pre-orientation drug use later, even if it were originally waiverable, may result in disenrollment or dismissal from AFROTC based on fraudulent entry.

##### 4.7.2.{#4_7_2} Drug Demand Reduction Program (DDRP).

HQ AFROTC executes the Department of the Air Force's Zero Tolerance policy on illicit drug use and will enhance cadets' training experience by introducing them to the DDRP. Therefore, all cadets pursuing a commission are subject to random drug testing any time after program entry during the school year or at FT. Accordingly, they are required to sign a DDRP MOU (Attachment 11) upon program entry. NOTE: When contracting and new student orientation occur on the same day, the AF Form 1056 is the source document for the DDRP program and the MOU is not required.

+ 4.7.2.1. Failure to Comply/Report. Unless an authorized excusal exists, failure to comply or report for a mandatory urinalysis test will be considered an unauthorized absence and will result in individual command-directed screening or dismissal/disenrollment from the AFROTC program. Additionally, administrative action in the form of a CE may result.

+ 4.7.2.2. Positive Testing. Any individual testing positive on a urinalysis test will be investigated for disenrollment or dismissed from the AFROTC Program IAW Chapter 11 of this instruction. All appeals will follow normal guidance.

##### 4.7.3.{#4_7_3} AF Form 2030 Initial Preparation.

HSSP applicants will complete the AF Form 2030 during their interview. The AF Form 2030 will be maintained in WINGS and forwarded to RRUC with the interview.

##### 4.7.4.{#4_7_4} Evaluation of Drug Use or Abuse.

When an applicant has indicated any illicit drug usage on the AF Form 2030, the following procedures apply:

+ 4.7.4.1. Individual Evaluation Request. Have the applicant provide a handwritten statement in the Remarks Section of the AF Form 2030 concerning the circumstances of each drug use occurrence. If necessary, continue on a separate page and attach it to the cadet's AF Form 2030 that will be filed in the UPRG. On the top and bottom of each page of the handwritten statement, print or stamp "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY," and treat as Privacy Act information.

+ 4.7.4.2. As a minimum, have applicants include the following for each illicit drug use occurrence:

	+ 4.7.4.2.1. Dates and circumstances surrounding each occurrence. Include specific reasons for the incidents and total number of times used. NOTE: Taking a total of 8 "inhalations" during an around-the-circle smoking game is ONE incident, not eight.

	+ 4.7.4.2.2. Specific drug or combination of drugs used.

	+ 4.7.4.2.3. Describe any residual effects.

	+ 4.7.4.2.4. Indicate current feelings toward usage and whether or not applicant would use them again.

	+ 4.7.4.2.5. Include any other information that would be helpful in evaluation of waiver.

	+ 4.7.4.2.6. Sign and date the statement.

##### 4.7.5.{#4_7_5} Drug Use Waivers.

+ 4.7.5.1. Waivers are permitted only for qualified applicants whose pre-application drug usage was limited in frequency and scope and unlikely to recur.

+ 4.7.5.2. Detachment Commander Waivers. Detachment Commanders may waive use of marijuana provided no civil involvement other than possession and was limited in frequency as defined below.

	+ 4.7.5.2.1. Use limited to 5 times or less. Detachment Commander may waive use of marijuana or synthetic cannabinoids provided no civil involvement other than possession.

	+ 4.7.5.2.2. Use the applicant's statement, along with a personal interview, to determine if the requirements are met. The Detachment Commander will sign and date statements. For AFROTC policy for HSSP recipients, see paragraph 4.8. Authorize program entry by annotating in the remarks section of the AF Form 2030 with the following statements:

		+ 4.7.5.2.2.1. "Pre-application limited experimental use of marijuana or synthetic cannabinoids unlikely to recur. I waive the use and grant program entry."

		+ 4.7.5.2.2.2. "Member has been briefed and agrees to abide by Air Force policy regarding the prohibited use of illegal drugs. Program entry is authorized."

+ 4.7.5.3. The Detachment Commander may decide not to grant a waiver for substance abuse.

+ 4.7.5.4. Waivers for drug use beyond the authority of Detachment Commanders may be submitted to AFROTC/RRF.

	+ 4.7.5.4.1. AFROTC/RR may consider granting a waiver for use of other drugs as outlined in AFI 36-2002, Regular Air Force and Special Category Accessions. Currently, use of amphetamines, barbiturates, or anabolic steroids may be waived. No other drugs (to include using someone else's prescription) will be considered for a waiver.

	+ 4.7.5.4.2. HQ AFROTC/RRFP will not consider waiver requests for the illegal use or possession of more than one drug or grant waivers for manufacturing or distribution.

	+ 4.7.5.4.3. If an applicant indicated on their statement that they did not know the substance they were using was an illegal drug, the Detachment Commander may submit a waiver request to AFROTC/RRF even though the drug is not on the list of waiverable drugs. Be certain the applicant includes on the AF Form 2030 an explanation of why they did not know they were ingesting an illegal drug and what residual effects or flashbacks they have experienced. The intent of this paragraph is to consider a waiver for individuals who were unknowingly drugged by someone else. It is not intended to waive "I knew it was a drug, but I did not know which drug."

	+ 4.7.5.4.4. Independent Evidence of Drug/Hemp Use. When evidence of an applicant's/cadet's drug/hemp usage is brought to the attention of the Detachment Commander by a third party, the Detachment Commander must contact Holm Center/JA for advice on the appropriate course of action based on assessment of evidence and allegations. After consulting with Holm Center/JA, the following actions apply:

		+ 4.7.5.4.4.1. Gather and verify available independent evidence.

		+ 4.7.5.4.4.2. The Detachment Commander will counsel the applicant/cadet via AFROTC Form 16 that evidence has been received of alleged drug/hemp usage.

		+ 4.7.5.4.4.3. The Detachment Commander will ask the applicant/cadet for an explanation. Document all comments.

		+ 4.7.5.4.4.4. If the applicant/cadet admits the alleged drug/hemp usage, dismiss (non-contract) or investigate for disenrollment. If the applicant/cadet denies the alleged drug/hemp usage, contact Holm Center/JA to evaluate the evidence for possible dismissal. Closely monitor retained cadets.

+ 4.7.5.5. Drug Abuse or Use of Hemp Derivative after Orientation.

	+ 4.7.5.5.1. Cadets are not eligible for enlistment or commissioning if they use illegal drugs as defined in AFI 44-121, Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program, or use of hemp derivatives or synthetic cannabinoids (e.g. "Spice), following orientation to the Air Force Drug and Alcohol Abuse Policy as documented on the AF Form 2030. This is not waiverable. Prescription drug use without a prescription is also considered illegal drug use and will result in disenrollment.

	+ 4.7.5.5.2. Contract Cadets. Conduct a disenrollment investigation on a cadet who violates this policy. Initiate the investigation for failure to maintain military retention standards and ascertain all facts and circumstances pertaining to the violation. Do not request a waiver of the disenrollment process (reference Chapter 11,).

	+ 4.7.5.5.3. Non-contract Cadets: Drop or place in Special Student Status any cadet who violates this Air Force Policy. Counsel cadets via AFROTC Form 16 for failure to maintain military retention standards.

	+ 4.7.5.5.4. Following orientation, drug use brought to the attention of the Detachment Commander by a third party must be reviewed and a course of action assessed. Contact Holm Center/JA for guidance.

----

#### 4.8.{#4_8} Drug Use and/or Alcohol Use/Abuse or New Civil Involvements Waivers for High School Scholarship Program (HSSP) Recipients.

##### 4.8.1.{#4_8_1} Detachment Commanders cannot waive drug use or alcohol use, Category 4 or 5 civil involvements identifying alcohol or drug use or abuse on the AF Form 2030 and AFROTC Form 35 for HSSP recipients. These waivers must come to AFROTC/RRU for approval. The rationale is to ensure the scholarship was not obtained through fraudulent means by failing to identify drug use during the scholarship interview.

##### 4.8.2.{#4_8_2} AFROTC policy is to withdraw the scholarship offer for students who failed to properly disclose civil involvements and for drug or alcohol abuse that occurred prior to the HSSP interview. These scholarships are considered obtained under fraudulent circumstances since the student failed to obtain a required waiver.

##### 4.8.3.{#4_8_3} Drug use or alcohol abuse after the scholarship interview is considered "post orientation" since the AF Form 2030 is certified during the interview. IAW the AF Form 2030, Section III, Paragraph II, "any drug use (including marijuana) or any alcohol abuse as described above, FROM THIS DATE FORWARD, renders me ineligible for the Air Force". Therefore, scholarship offer is withdrawn and applicant is not eligible for AFROTC.

----

#### 4.9.{#4_9} Family Members.

##### 4.9.1.{#4_9_1} For a definition of "family member," refer to AFI 36-2908, Family Care Plans.

##### 4.9.2.{#4_9_2} AFROTC Applicants or non-contract cadets with family members incapable of self- care.

AFI 36-2011, AFROTC Program, requires all contracted members to meet AF enlistment standards in AFI 36-2002, Regular Air Force and Special Category Accessions.

+ 4.9.2.1. Enlistment- An AFROTC cadet who has a dependent incapable of self-care and is single, divorced, separated or married to a military spouse, must have an approved Family Care Plan completed IAW AFI 36-2908, Family Care Plans, before enlistment.

	+ 4.9.2.1.1. AFROTC cadets with more than two dependents under the age of 18 who are incapable of self-care are not eligible for enlistment.

	+ 4.9.2.1.2. Waivers may be requested to permit accession of applicants with up to one additional dependent (maximum total of three dependents under the age of 18 who are incapable of self-care) for enlistment. Dependency waiver authority may be delegated no lower than the respective AFROTC Region Commander. Applicants must provide a detachment commander approved family Care Plan IAW AFI 36-2908 prior to approval of any dependency waiver.

+ 4.9.2.2. Commissioning- There are no dependency restrictions for AFROTC cadets so long as a cadet who has a dependent incapable of self-care and is single, divorced, separated or married to a military spouse, has a current and approved Family Care Plan completed IAW AFI 36-2908, Family Care Plans, prior to and as of the day of commissioning.

+ 4.9.2.3. Waiverable. A waiver may be considered for an applicant wishing to enlist in pay grade E-3 or lower who is married to a civilian spouse, has two or more family members incapable of self-care, and is normally ineligible for enlistment. Waiver authority is AFROTC/RR.

##### 4.9.3.{#4_9_3} Detachment Commanders are authorized to approve Family Care Plans in accordance with paragraph 4.9.2.

Detachment Commanders must counsel the contract cadet according to AFI 36-2908 and ensure the cadet fully understands the Air Force policy on the relationship between family care responsibilities and accomplishment of military duties, both in peacetime and during contingency operations. Ensure that the Family Care Plan is reasonable and usable. For example, listing another cadet as a care provider is not reasonable since the other cadet is also required to attend AS classes and LLab at the same time the cadet with dependent(s) must attend.

+ 4.9.3.1. Cadets will complete and maintain an AF Form 357, Family Care Certification IAW AFI 36-2908. The AF Form 357 must reflect time spent in AFROTC. Additionally, cadets must annotate the dependency situation on the AF Form 3010 (signed/dated by the cadet and an AFROTC representative). NOTE: Attachment 14, Statement of Understanding, must be recertified by cadet and an AFROTC representative at time of enlistment (or any time change in dependency status occurs).

+ 4.9.3.2. The Detachment Commander, if satisfied with the cadet's family care arrangements, prepares and signs the following statement: "The applicant's family care arrangements are valid and will adequately cover the time period the applicant spends in AFROTC. File statement in Section I of the UPRG. If the Detachment Commander is not satisfied with the validity of the cadet's family care arrangements, the commander will initiate a disenrollment action for failure to maintain military retention standards or det drop.

##### 4.9.4.{#4_9_4} Ensure that all applicants and cadets complete and recertify the AF Form 3010 and Air Force Dependency Policy Statement of Understanding (Attachment 14) at the appropriate times, (e.g., upon application, just prior to enlistment, prior to commissioning, and any time a change in dependency status occurs).

----

#### 4.10.{#4_10} Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT) Requirements.

##### 4.10.1.{#4_10_1} The minimum scores required to commission are Verbal-15 and Quantitative-10. AFOQT scores are percentiles, so a score of 15 in the verbal portion means the person was in the bottom 15 percent of people taking the test.

##### 4.10.2.{#4_10_2} Timing. All cadets must take the AFOQT NLT 31 December of their AS200 year, however, cadets are discouraged from taking the AFOQT prior to their sophomore year in college. The AFOQT was designed for 3rd-year college students and students in their freshman year typically have taken fewer college-level courses in preparation for the test. Cadets who elect to test in their freshman year should be counseled beforehand on the limited number of authorized attempts.

##### 4.10.3.{#4_10_3} Retests: Cadets may retest at least 150 days after the previous attempt (for test preparation). The second test (or first retest) can be taken no earlier than the sophomore year.

+ 4.10.3.1. When a second retest (third attempt) is authorized, the retest will be accomplished between the start of AS300 class and 31 December of that year. NOTE: The overall intent is that a cadet could potentially test twice in their sophomore year and once in the first semester of their junior year.

	+ 4.10.3.1.1. To accomplish a second retest (third attempt) an AFROTC Form 22 waiver package will be initiated by the Detachment Commander and routed through AFROTC/RRFA for AFPC approval/disapproval. Include the below items as well as the standard required documents when submitting the Form 22 waiver for consideration.

		+ 4.10.3.1.1.2. To be considered for a second retest (third attempt) the cadet will be required to provide proof of at least one college level course (with a passing score) in a subject relevant to the portion of the AFOQT failed or at least one SAT/ACT preparatory course following the last AFOQT failure (Example, cadet failed the verbal portion of the AFOQT; cadet will then be required to complete a college level English course and show proof it was completed/passed before a waiver will be considered) or a minimum of 24 hours of one-on-one tutoring in a subject relevant to the portion of the AFOQT failed. Ideally, the cadet should have taken similar preparation steps prior to their first retake.

		+ 4.10.3.1.1.2. Cadet will be required to write a memorandum indicating why he/she should be allowed an opportunity for a second retest.

##### 4.10.4.{#4_10_4} Scholarships.

Scholarships previously activated are not affected by first-time AFOQT verbal and/or quantitative failures. Second-time AFOQT verbal and/or quantitative failures will result in scholarship suspension.

##### 4.10.5.{#4_10_5} POC Selection Process (PSP).

Failing the AFOQT is not a disqualifier for the POC Selection Process (PSP), but cadets awarded an EA will not attend FTU (they will be deferred) or enlist (contract) until AFOQT qualified. Cadets must have AFOQT scores to be eligible to compete for PSP.

+ 4.10.5.1. Exception: Cadets contracted as freshmen, i.e. before taking the AFOQT, are already enlisted, but will not be able to attend FTU until AFOQT qualified.

##### 4.10.6.{#4_10_6} ICSP/CICS Nomination and Contracting/Enlistment.

Cadets who achieve failing verbal or quantitative AFOQT scores are ineligible for scholarship nomination, award, activation or contracting into the POC. Cadets in this situation, upon POC entry, will be placed in pursuing status for one semester. Cadets placed in pursuing status for failing AFOQT scores must pass the AFOQT NLT the 31 December of the AS300 year or be "Det Dropped", unless a waiver is granted.

##### 4.10.7.{#4_10_7} Contracted cadets.

Contract cadets who do not pass the AFOQT prior to 31 December of their AS300 year must be investigated for disenrollment and are subject to recoupment or call to EAD.

##### 4.10.8.{#4_10_8} Re-testing for Rated Categorization.

Historical data show a significant increase in the pilot composite score (10-25 percentile points) for cadets who re-took the AFOQT prior to the rated categorization board. Based on these results, AFROTC/RR authorizes a voluntary retest of the AFOQT for cadets who desire rated categorization and who have only taken the AFOQT once. Retesting of these cadets is highly encouraged but not mandatory.

+ 4.10.8.1. For cadets who barely passed the verbal or quantitative portions of the AFOQT the first time place their qualification at risk if they retake the AFOQT. Taking this test a second time to improve their rated scores opens up the possibility that the AFOQT verbal or quantitative score might drop below the required verbal or quantitative minimums for program entry. Counsel cadets on the risks before allowing the retest.

----

#### 4.11.{#4_11} Special Testing Requirements for Non-Native English-Speaking Cadets

##### 4.11.1.{#4_11_1} Cadets must demonstrate adequate English proficiency before entering the POC and before commissioning.

Once a cadet passes the AFOQT, no further language comprehension or proficiency tests are required. If the AFOQT is not passed after two attempts, cadets must take the Defense Language Institute's (DLI) English Comprehension Level (ECL) Test and the Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI) and meet the criteria in Figure 4.2. Cadets must attempt the AFOQT twice before being administered the ECL and OPI. The ECL/OPI option applies ONLY to the Verbal portion of the AFOQT and cannot be used as a substitute for failing scores on the Quantitative portion of the test. Additionally, cadets who have not met the criteria in Figure 4.2 by 90 days prior to commissioning will be investigated for disenrollment.

Figure 4.2. Minimum English Comprehension Level (ECL)/Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI) Scores if AFOQT has not been passed.
 POC Entry Commissioning
ECL 80 90
OPI 1+/1+ 2+/2+

##### 4.11.2.{#4_11_2} This section applies only to cadets who have failed the AFOQT twice, who speak English as a Second Language (ESL) and have attended American schools less than five years. Using a second language in the home does not necessarily qualify a student for ESL consideration. Before 90 days prior to DOC/DOG, these cadets must take the ECL and OPI and meet the commissioning criteria in Figure 4.2. Cadets who have not met this criteria will be investigated for disenrollment.

+ 4.11.2.1. ECL Test. Applicants may be referred to the nearest Military Enlistment Processing Station (MEPS) or other agency possessing ECL testing capability. Detachments must limit the ECL testing of cadets to one administration per year.

+ 4.11.2.2. OPI Test. Detachments may schedule a telephonic OPI by contacting the DLI English Language Center at Lackland AFB, TX. Tests are accomplished at no cost to the cadet or detachment.

----

#### 4.12.{#4_12} Waiver of Disenrollment from Previous Officer Training.

##### 4.12.1.{#4_12_1} The Detachment Commander may approve waivers for former AFROTC cadets who received a recommendation for future officer training on the DD Form 785, Record of Disenrollment from Officer Candidate-Type Training, section IV, blocks 1, 2 or 6.

+ 4.12.1.1. When waiver is granted by the Detachment Commander, document on an AFROTC Form 16 and place in the UPRG.

+ 4.12.1.2. For previously disenrolled AFROTC cadets, contact HQ AFROTC/RRFP to reactivate the cadet's record in WINGS.

##### 4.12.2.{#4_12_2} Any cadet who resigns or is eliminated from another commissioning source for an honor code violation, regardless of the recommendation on the DD Form 785 or DD Form 214 will not be allowed to compete for an EA without a waiver. Waiver requests are submitted to AFROTC/RRF through the normal AFROTC Form 22 process; however, AFROTC/CC is the waiver authority.

##### 4.12.3.{#4_12_3} AFROTC Region Commander is the approval authority for all other waivers of previous disenrollments. In addition to the required attachments, include a copy of the DD Form 785, Record of Disenrollment From Officer Candidate-Type Training; a handwritten and signed statement by the applicant stating the reason for disenrollment; and DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, (if previously enlisted or at a Service Academy). A USAFA cadet with an ADSC must provide proof of release from the ADSC from the SAF and HQ AFPC/DPAAES to the Detachment Commander for inclusion in the request.

+ 4.12.3.1. Former Service Academy Cadets. The following statement must be included in their handwritten statement: "I certify that I had no honor code incidents, involvements or resignation in lieu thereof."

##### 4.12.4.{#4_12_4} Maintain a copy of all previous DD Forms 4, Enlistment/Reenlistment Document Armed Forces of the United States, of cadets disenrolled from Service Academies or ROTC programs in the cadet's UPRG. All DD Forms 4 are forwarded to HQ AFPC at time of commission and a Date Initially Entered Military Service (DIEMS) is established.

----

#### 4.13.{#4_13} Waiver of Prior Service.

##### 4.13.1.{#4_13_1} Applicants who were prior service members of any branch of the armed forces must have their prior service verified prior to granting membership to verify reenlistment eligibility. This verification is accomplished using the DD Form 214.

##### 4.13.2.{#4_13_2} All DD Forms 214 must have eligibility verified by AFROTC/RRFA (except as indicated in paragraph 4.13.4.). For verification, submit the DD Form 214, Copy 4 (member copy) to HQ AFROTC/RRFA via email to afrotc.rrfa@us.af.mil.

##### 4.13.3.{#4_13_3} If an applicant has a disqualifying Re-Enlistment (RE) code, you may terminate the application or submit a waiver via AFROTC Form 22 to AFROTC/RRFA. Include a copy of the DD Form 214 and a statement from the individual explaining the reason for release or discharge. If the applicant was discharged for hardship, they must furnish proof of the termination of the condition existing at the time of discharge. NOTE: If the member's copy of the DD Form 214 cannot be furnished, be sure to include the following information: full name, SSN or service number, date of discharge, and component. As a minimum, the request must include:

+ 4.13.3.1. A personal statement that the hardship no longer exists.

+ 4.13.3.2. Statements by members of the community who are familiar with the hardship conditions confirming the hardship no longer exists.

+ 4.13.3.3. A statement of understanding that another hardship discharge may not be granted for similar reasons if hardship was due to chronic illness of parent or parent- in- law or other immediate family member.

##### 4.13.4.{#4_13_4} DD Form 214 that does not need to be verified:

+ 4.13.4.1. Active Reserve or Guard members conditionally released for the specific purpose of entering AFROTC.

+ 4.13.4.2. Members entering AFROTC through Enlisted Commissioning Programs (ECP) (Reference AFI 36-2013).

+ 4.13.4.3. While DD Form 214 is not required for enlistment, it must be requested after enlistment in the ORS. This will ensure that all appropriate forms are included in the UPRG for commissioning purposes or in the event that discharge or disenrollment actions become necessary. Guard members with less than 90 consecutive days on EAD will not have a DD Form 214.

----

#### 4.14.{#4_14} AFROTC Form 48, Planned Academic Program, or Equivalent.

##### 4.14.1.{#4_14_1} The academic plan is designed to ensure each applicant meets graduation and program completion requirements in a realistic manner while maintaining two years in the POC and within the fiscal year of commissioning indicated on the AF Form 1056. A sound, realistic academic plan is critical to ensuring academic success, is the source document for a cadet's projected graduation date, and guides the cadet and detachment staff to that graduation.

+ 4.14.1.1. The detachment may develop or use a locally-developed academic program guide in lieu of the AFROTC Form 48. If used, this optional plan must meet the requirements as defined in this section. Detachment personnel must ensure the cadet's academic program is realistic.

+ 4.14.1.2. Once the academic plan is established, at a minimum, all cadets must have their academic plan reevaluated and recertified by their academic advisor every fall term. This will ensure the cadet is on schedule with their established graduation/commissioning date. The AFROTC Form 48 is not complete until it is certified by a university official.

+ 4.14.1.3. Applicants and cadets wishing to pursue a commission must have a completed academic plan by the end of their first term in AFROTC, prior to competing for a scholarship, or prior to PSP, whichever occurs earlier. This includes the 3-year Type 2 scholarship freshmen who will not activate scholarships until the beginning of their sophomore year.

+ 4.14.1.4. All cadets must have a university-approved/certified academic plan prior to contracting. Exception: 4-yr HSSP cadet activating a scholarship in the fall of the freshman year.

+ 4.14.1.5. Detachment personnel must enter required cadet data into WINGS for all cadets taking AFROTC courses at the time of enrollment.

+ 4.14.1.6. Use the academic plan to determine the appropriate AS class for a cadet. For example, a cadet may have enough hours to be classified as a sophomore with the university, but still have four years remaining to graduate based on his academic plan. In this case, place the cadet in AS100. This increases scholarship opportunities and allows the cadre more time to evaluate the cadet's officership potential.

+ 4.14.1.7. Completion of the A F RO T C Form 48 is a combined responsibility. AFROTC requires support of the university counselor in assisting with the building of a realistic academic plan. The cadre should review the academic plan to make sure it is realistic and achievable based on the student's past academic performance. Compare the academic plan with the university catalog for the academic degree and discuss with the university counselor if necessary. The ultimate responsibility for a realistic academic plan falls on the student. The cadet should understand their own academic abilities.

##### 4.14.2.{#4_14_2} Entry into the POC is programmed to permit concurrent completion of degree and commissioning requirements. The individual must program two academic years of full- time study remaining in an accredited degree granting institution upon entry into the POC. The number of credit hours required for full-time student status during any term is the minimum number specified in the institutional catalog. If the institution does not specify a full-time enrollment, HQ AFROTC specifies a minimum of 12 hours for undergraduate level courses and 9 hours for graduate level courses, including AFROTC courses.

+ 4.14.2.1. Time spent in a period of non-attendance (PNA) may be counted as part of the two academic years in those cases when concurrent POC enrollment is authorized.

+ 4.14.2.2. Do not submit applicants for POC membership whose academic programs show they will require a total of more than 1 academic year in completed status.

##### 4.14.3.{#4_14_3} Individuals whose academic programs show they will require more terms to complete degree requirements than the number for which they are entitled to scholarship benefits, or who will have more than 2 academic years remaining upon POC entry, will be programmed for a period of completed status not to exceed one academic year. PNA is not authorized in lieu of completed status.

##### 4.14.4.{#4_14_4} See Attachment 15 for instructions on completing the AFROTC Form 48.

##### 4.14.5.{#4_14_5} Academic Plan maintenance, re-evaluation, and re-accomplishment.

+ 4.14.5.1. Retain the complete academic plan in the cadet UPRG. Corrections and revisions are acceptable. Make course changes by adding the new course and lining out or erasing the changed course. NOTE: An AFROTC Form 48 is only considered "complete" when all previously completed course work has been incorporated into the new plan.

	+ 4.14.5.1.1. When requesting a new major through AFROTC/RRFA, do NOT discard the old academic plan until the new major has been approved and a new "complete" academic plan has been obtained.

	+ 4.14.5.1.2. When releasing the academic plan to the cadet for university reviews, be sure to make a copy, just in case it is lost.

+ 4.15.5.2. Reevaluation of academic plan. Once the academic plan is established, at a minimum, all cadets must have their academic plan reevaluated and recertified by their university academic advisor every fall term. During fall reevaluations, the academic advisor will review the entire academic plan to ensure the cadet is still on schedule to receive a degree and to graduate as indicated on the academic plan or make any necessary changes. Upon reevaluating the academic plan, the academic advisor will sign/date in the "remarks" section of the academic plan in the appropriate fall term the review is conducted.

+ 4.15.5.3. Re-accomplishment of academic plan. A cadet is only required to complete a new academic plan when he/she changes academic major, institutions, or requires a DOG and/or DOC change into a new fiscal year. A reaccomplished academic plan will include previous coursework and detachments will annotate previous cadre term reviews and academic advisor fall term reviews.

+ 4.14.5.4. All scholarship cadets (except Nurses) must accomplish the Academic Plan for Foreign Language or Technical Requirements For Scholarship Cadets (Attachment 7) to supplement the AFROTC Form 48.

----

#### 4.15.{#4_15} Special Student.

##### 4.15.1.{#4_15_1} Special students may enroll in AFROTC classes for academic course credit only. They are not to be issued a uniform and do not participate in LLAB, PT or PMT events. Do not enroll a cadet who is pursuing a commission into POC classes without an enrollment allocation. Detachments may enroll cadets pursuing a commission, but not yet qualified to be an active cadet, as applicants. Applicants are authorized PT and LLAB participation provided the detachment has, at a minimum, a sports physical on file.

##### 4.15.2.{#4_15_2} The following items apply to Special students:

+ 4.15.2.1. They are not authorized to compete in any selection program.

+ 4.15.2.2. They will not receive an EA.

+ 4.15.2.3. They will not be enlisted.

+ 4.15.2.4. They will not be commissioned.

+ 4.15.2.5. They will not be administered the Oath of Allegiance (AFROTC Form 20, page 2).

----

#### 4.16.{#4_16} Non-US Citizen Students.

##### 4.16.1.{#4_16_1} Non-US citizen students are considered applicants if they intend to pursue a commission. No action is required to remove a student from the program who fails to obtain US citizenship except to update a "Det Drop" in WINGS.

##### 4.16.2.{#4_16_2} Immigrants, regardless of their country of origin, who have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence, pursuing citizenship in the United States and have in their possession an Immigration Form I-551, Permanent Resident Card, may participate as applicants. Counsel the cadet, via the AFROTC Form 16, to ensure that there is no misunderstanding that being approved to participate in AFROTC (GMC or POC levels) is no guarantee that an EA will be available when citizenship is obtained (see paragraph 4.16.4.1.).

##### 4.16.3.{#4_16_3} Non-immigrant students (students not intending to establish permanent residence in US), who have been lawfully admitted in the United States and have enrolled and been accepted at host university may participate in AFROTC academic classes as special students. Individuals in this status have acknowledged that they do not intend to apply for US citizenship.

##### 4.16.4.{#4_16_4} Non-US citizen applicants participating in AFROTC may compete for an EA and FT attendance IAW the following guidelines:

+ 4.16.4.1. Provided the applicant can obtain US citizenship within 12 months after PSP. Place cadets who received an EA and successfully complete FT in pursuing status until receipt of US citizenship. Counsel these cadets that failure to obtain citizenship will result in loss of EA and that satisfactorily completing requirements for citizenship is their responsibility. AFROTC/RRFP will not grant EA changes to next FY to cover delays in obtaining citizenship. Have the applicant sign the following Statement of Understanding on an AFROTC Form 16 in order to compete for PSP without proof of citizenship:

	+ 4.16.4.1.1. "I understand that I am within the 12-month point for applying for my citizenship. I also understand that I cannot apply for citizenship until 90 days prior to my citizenship eligibility date. I am competing for an AFROTC enrollment allocation based on this timeframe. I will file for my citizenship 90 days prior to my eligibility. I will provide copies of my citizenship package to the Detachment Commander when filed. If I do not file the package at the 90-day point of my citizenship eligibility date, my enrollment allocation will be withdrawn. If I do not receive my citizenship, my enrollment allocation will be withdrawn." Non-US citizens cannot be contracted until citizenship is received and verified. Failure to receive US citizenship will result in loss of EA.

----

#### 4.17.{#4_17} Military Status. 

AFROTC membership does not confer active duty military status upon cadets. While contract cadets are inactive reservists in the Individual Ready Reserve, they are in civilian status and are not subject to the provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Status as cadets and reservists can make cadets eligible for certain benefits, such as limited use of morale, welfare, and recreation activities, reimbursement for travel to and from some AFROTC training events, and Air Force-funded medical care for injuries related to AFROTC training. It does not make the cadet eligible for legal services, including support in disenrollment investigations.

----

#### 4.18.{#4_18} GMC Membership.

##### 4.18.1.{#4_18_1} Eligible (applicant and active) students who formally participate in AS100 and/or AS200 classes and LLAB while enrolled in school may be members of the GMC and are GMC cadets. Cadets may be members of the GMC as a non-scholarship or scholarship cadet. GMC membership does not guarantee scholarship activation or POC entry.

##### 4.18.2.{#4_18_2} Enroll cadets into the appropriate AS class level based on the time they have remaining to complete AFROTC and their degree, not necessarily how the university classifies the student. For example, a walk-on cadet is classified by the university as a junior due to the number of class hours completed but still has six semesters remaining until his DOC/DOG. This cadet should be enrolled as an AS250 cadet. Use the academic plan to help you determine the length of time remaining to graduation. DO NOT automatically use the university classification for the student.

##### 4.18.3.{#4_18_3} Non-scholarship cadets:

+ 4.18.3.1. Remain members of the GMC until they voluntarily withdraw, are dismissed, are placed in Special Student status, or enter the POC.

+ 4.18.3.2. Not selected for an enrollment allocation may continue in both AS classes and LLAB until completion of the AS200 year.

##### 4.18.4.{#4_18_4} Scholarship cadets remain members of the GMC until they enter the POC or are disenrolled.

##### 4.18.5.{#4_18_5} Completed GMC (AS500) cadets are non-contract cadets who have completed all GMC requirements and desire to remain in the program for future POC selection consideration. AS500 cadets do not attend AS classes (Exception: SMCs where ROTC classes are mandatory) but must participate in LLAB to a level determined by the Detachment Commander. AS500 cadets are eligible for scholarship nomination and award only if scholarship entitlements are programmed to be activated upon entering the POC.

##### 4.18.6.{#4_18_6} GMC Counseling. As a minimum, administer term counseling to all non-contract GMC cadets upon program entry and every fall term. GMC cadets on scholarship must be counseled each term.

----

#### 4.19.{#4_19} GMC Membership Duration.

##### 4.19.1.{#4_19_1} The GMC normally covers two academic years. However, the Detachment Commander may authorize dual enrollment in the GMC (AS250) if necessary for timing to allow 2 full years in the POC. NOTE: Concurrent enrollment in the GMC and POC is NOT authorized.

##### 4.19.2.{#4_19_2} Cadets must complete all of the GMC academics prior to FT attendance.

----

#### 4.20.{#4_20} GMC Accreditation.

##### 4.20.1.{#4_20_1} If a cadet requests GMC accreditation, the Detachment Commander may accredit the GMC for successful completion of military training as indicated below (counsel cadet on AFROTC Form 16):

+ 4.20.1.1. Cadets with four or more years of academics remaining are ineligible for GMC accreditation without prior AFROTC/RRF approval via AFROTC Form 22 package. If approved, complete memorandum indicating length and type of accreditation granted signed by the Detachment Commander and file in cadet's UPRG.

+ 4.20.1.2. Military Service. The Detachment Commander may accredit up to the entire GMC for any verified periods of honorable service of 180 consecutive days or more, on extended active duty for training in enlisted status, and where a break in service is less than three years. Time spent in enlisted status while enrolled in an officer- commissioning program qualifies only if the individual was already in enlisted status when they entered that program.

+ 4.20.1.3. High School JROTC. Certification of successful completion of the applicable phases of junior ROTC of any United States Armed Forces (including National Defense Cadet Corps Training) is necessary before granting credit for this type of training. AFJROTC Form 310, AFJROTC Certificate of Completion, or AF Form 1256, Certificate of Training, is the only acceptable documents to verify successful completion of AFJROTC. Similar certificates from the other services or high school transcripts may be used to verify junior ROTC completion in another service. Attach proof of completion to the AFROTC Form 20 and place it in the cadet's UPRG. The Detachment Commander may grant accreditation as follows:

	+ 4.20.1.3.1. Three or four years of junior ROTC is considered equal to one year of the GMC. Normally, this is 2 semesters, 3 quarters, or an equivalent number of academic terms that comprise a maximum of one academic year.

	+ 4.20.1.3.2. Two years of junior ROTC is considered equal to one academic term of GMC.

	+ 4.20.1.3.3. No credit is given for less than 2 years of junior ROTC.

+ 4.20.1.4. Military High School Junior ROTC (JROTC). The Detachment Commander may accredit the GMC, or portions of the GMC, based on previous JROTC training of any United States Armed Forces component at a military school. Use the AFJROTC Form 310 to verify completion of 3 or 4 years of AFJROTC. Use the AF Form 1256 along with the individual's military high school transcript, to verify completion of 2 years of AFJROTC at a military school. Similar certificates from the other services or high school transcripts may be used to verify junior ROTC completion in another service. Attach proof of completion to the AFROTC Form 20 and place it in the cadet's UPRG. After verification of training, Det CC may grant equivalent credit as follows:

	+ 4.20.1.4.1. Four years of military school JROTC training is considered equal to the entire GMC.

	+ 4.20.1.4.2. Three years of military school JROTC training is considered equal to 3 semesters, 4 quarters, or an equivalent number of academic terms which comprise a maximum of 1 1/2 academic years.

	+ 4.20.1.4.3. Two years of military school JROTC training is considered equal to either year of the GMC.

	+ 4.20.1.4.4. No credit is given for less than 2 years of JROTC training at a military school.

##### 4.20.2.{#4_20_2} Senior ROTC (College-Level). The Detachment Commander may accredit, on a term-for-term basis, as much of the GMC as is considered equivalent to previous training received in the senior division of Army or Naval ROTC. Before granting credit for Army or Naval training however, the Detachment Commander will correspond with the appropriate professor of military science (PMS) or professor of naval science (PNS) to ensure Army or Naval records indicate the individual is a satisfactory candidate for AFROTC training based on their past ROTC training. Applicants who have completed only the first or basic FT program of Army or Naval ROTC may be accredited the entire GMC.

##### 4.20.3.{#4_20_3} Service Academy. The Detachment Commander may accredit, on a year-for-year or term-for-term basis, as much of the GMC as is considered equivalent to previous training at a Service Academy (Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, or Merchant Marine) or a service academy preparatory school.

##### 4.20.4.{#4_20_4} Civil Air Patrol (CAP) Awards. The Detachment Commander may accredit portions of the GMC for receipt of a CAP award. Obtain a copy of the certificate of award from the individual, attach it to the AFROTC Form 20, and place it in the cadet's UPRG. Only the highest award is accredited. The awards are not cumulative.

+ 4.20.4.1. The Carl A. Spaatz Award (may be shown as Phase 4) or the Ira C. Eaker Award is considered as being equal to three semesters, four quarters, or an equivalent number of other academic terms that comprise a maximum of 1 1/2 academic years.

+ 4.20.4.2. The Amelia Earhart Award is considered equal to either year of the GMC.

+ 4.20.4.3. The Billy Mitchell Award is considered equal to any academic term of the GMC.

----

#### 4.21.{#4_21} Leadership Lab (LLAB) Grade Failures and Field Training Results.

##### 4.21.1.{#4_21_1} LLAB Grade Failures and PFA. All cadets must attempt the PFA. If a contract cadet receives a failing score on the PFA it does not constitute a failure of LLAB, but does warrant a CE. If a cadet meets all attendance requirements, but fails to attempt the PFA, they will fail LLAB. Waiver requests to retain cadets in AFROTC in spite of LLAB failure must be submitted via AFROTC Form 22 to AFROTC/RRFA.

+ 4.21.1.1. EXCEPTIONS: Contract cadets on medical recheck status unable to take the PFA during the term, and non-contract cadets who have a bona fide medical excuse lasting through the end of the term. For cadets on medical recheck status, refer to guidelines in Chapter 5 and AFROTC Sup to AFI 36-2905.

+ 4.21.1.2. Failure to Meet Standards (Contract) or Make Satisfactory Progress (Non- Contract).

	+ 4.21.1.2.1. For contract cadets, the following events constitute a failure to meet AFROTC fitness standards: failure to pass any official PFA or failure to meet PT attendance requirements for the term.

	+ 4.21.1.2.2. For non-contract cadets, the following events constitute a failure to make satisfactory progress: failure to attempt an official PFA during any term; three consecutive semesters or five quarters with PFA failures; and/or failure to meet PT attendance requirements for the term.

##### 4.21.2.{#4_21_2} Counseling requirements for cadets selected for FT.

+ 4.21.2.1. Prior to FT attendance, counsel on a AFROTC Form 16 all cadets competing for an EA that their retention in AFROTC is dependent on satisfactorily completing FT. Cadets who do not satisfactorily complete FT are not permitted to enter the POC or enroll in AS300 class (EXCEPTION: SMC may enroll in AS300 academic course only as required by the university). Award a CE to all contract cadets who are removed from FT with prejudice, (e.g., self-initiated elimination, inability to pass the PFA, honor code violations, failure to adapt to the military environment, etc.) place them in AS500 status (which has no academic portion), and ensure they continue to attend LLAB until the disenrollment is resolved. Withdraw their current EA. Temporarily inactivate scholarship until receipt of an AFROTC/RR decision. Non- contract cadets removed from FT with prejudice will be "Det Dropped from AFROTC.

	+ 4.21.2.1.1. Cadets removed from FT with prejudice may be considered for retention and FT deferral on a case-by-case basis. Temporarily inactivate scholarship until a final determination has been made.

	+ 4.21.2.1.2. If the cadet was scheduled to be commissioned upon completion of FT, take immediate action to extend the DOC and notify AFPC of possible delay.

	+ 4.21.2.1.3. Retention and deferral requests are initiated by the Detachment Commander and routed through the respective Region Commander via the AFROTC Form 22.

		+ 4.21.2.1.3.1. If the Region Commander non-concurs, the deferral process ends and the cadet will be investigated for disenrollment.

		+ 4.21.2.1.3.2. If the Region Commander concurs, the request is submitted to HQ AFROTC/DO for coordination within AFROTC/DO and AFROTC/RR for final determination by AFROTC/CC.

	+ 4.21.2.1.4. Unsatisfactory/Marginal Ratings: Cadets returning from FT who meet one of the following criteria in any area on the Field Training Performance Report will be made an AS500 and will be investigated for disenrollment (contract cadets) or Det Dropped (non-contract cadets). Cadets who meet this criteria are ineligible to re- compete for a new EA in the following PSP cycle.

		+ 4.21.2.1.4.1. Cadets who receive two or more unsatisfactory ratings.

		+ 4.21.2.1.4.2. Cadets who receive one unsatisfactory rating and two or more marginal ratings.

----

#### 4.22.{#4_22} Professional Officer Course (POC). 

The POC consists of AS300 and AS400 classes and LLAB. The POC is the third and fourth years of the 4-year program or the first and second years of the 2-year program. The POC entry date is the first day of institutional classes at the beginning of the POC. Update POC entry date retroactively to the first day of institutional classes in the term the cadet began participating in AS300 or AS400 classes. NOTE: Cadets properly deferred for FT may be eligible for enlistment if otherwise qualified and should wear the AS200 rank until FT is completed.

----

#### 4.23.{#4_23} POC Membership.

##### 4.23.1.{#4_23_1} Students who have met all eligibility requirements, have an enrollment allocation, and attend POC classes and LLAB while enrolled in school (or have a PNA authorized), are members of the POC.

##### 4.23.2.{#4_23_2} Cadets become POC members on the first day of host institutional classes.

##### 4.23.3.{#4_23_3} POC scholarship cadets who lose their scholarship due to inability to meet scholarship academic retention standards (reference paragraph 4.32) may remain POC members if they continue to meet cadet retention standards or as directed by HQ AFROTC.

----

#### 4.24.{#4_24} POC Membership Duration.

##### 4.24.1.{#4_24_1} The POC consists of two full academic years. An individual remains a POC member until disenrolled (or Det Dropped for non-contract) or commissioned. All cadets must be commissioned in their contracted FY within 30 days after completion of POC and academic degree requirements and upon meeting all other requirements (medical, NCLEX, etc.). AFROTC/RRF must approve delays in commissioning that result in change of FY.

##### 4.24.2.{#4_24_2} Concurrent Enrollment – AS450 Cadet. The Detachment Commander may authorize a POC member to enroll concurrently in two POC courses for a maximum of 1 academic term, provided the period between the cadet's entry into the POC and graduation is not reduced to less than 2 academic years and provided the cadet is/was participating in an authorized PNA program (reference paragraph 4.37). Reference AFROTC 36-2010 for completion of LLAB goals during the period of concurrent enrollment. NOTE: Concurrent enrollment in the GMC and POC is NOT authorized.

##### 4.23.3.{#4_23_3} Cadets must complete the full two years in the POC. Requests to commission early (less than two years in the POC) require AFROTC/RRF approval and will be granted only in exceptional cases.

----

#### 4.25.{#4_25} POC Entrance Requirements.

##### 4.25.1.{#4_25_1} The cadet must successfully complete the GMC (as applicable), have a POC EA and attend FT (or be properly deferred).

##### 4.25.2.{#4_25_2} All applicants for the POC must complete and pass all of the GMC academics prior to FT attendance.

##### 4.25.3.{#4_25_3} Cadets on academic probation must be placed in pursuing status (unless already contracted with a scholarship).

##### 4.25.4.{#4_25_4} Cadets must meet minimum CGPA requirements to compete for an EA (reference Attachment 12 and Chapter 8 of this instruction). Non-contract cadets must have both a TGPA and CGPA of 2.5 to contract into the POC. Upon successful completion of FT, non- contract cadets are placed in pursuing status for one semester to meet the TGPA and CGPA standards, if either GPA is substandard. Failure to meet the GPA standards within one semester will result in dismissal. Contract cadets are not authorized to attend FT while undergoing a disenrollment investigation unless the detachment commander is recommending retention in the AFROTC program.

+ 4.25.4.1. At those schools that do not specify a term and/or CGPA for good standing or without a grading system convertible to a numerical grade, the Detachment Commander must ensure the individual meets GPA standards as defined in Attachment 12. Because CGPA is a factor for competitive boards like scholarships, PSP, and rated categorization, cadets attending these universities will not be able to compete for those programs. They can, however, attend AS classes as a Special Student while in good standing with their university, provided that the university has a cross-town/consortium agreement with the detachment host university.

+ 4.25.4.2. If a transfer student is in good academic standing, the student may be admitted into the POC. If a transfer student is not in good academic standing, submit a waiver request to AFROTC/RRF. Adverse action is not necessary if institutional policy places all transfer students in probation status for the first term.

##### 4.25.5.{#4_25_5} For scholarship academic requirements, reference paragraph 4.32 of this instruction.

##### 4.25.6.{#4_25_6} Noncontract cadets awarded an EA but unsatisfactory AFOQT scores will be placed in pursuing status until the cadet achieves passing scores or is disenrolled.

##### 4.26.2.{#4_26_2} When considering POC accreditation, only credit as little as necessary. Place the new cadet in AS class corresponding to DOC. For example, if a Navy ROTC cadet has had 300- level classes, but requires 2 years to complete a degree, place the cadet in AS300 class. This will allow for two full years of AFROTC experience in POC.

##### 4.26.3.{#4_26_3} Submit requests via AFROTC Form 22 to AFROTC/RRFA for accreditation of the following:

+ 4.26.3.1. One additional POC term for a former Service Academy cadet who was disenrolled from the academy after successful completion of the first half of the senior year. Former academy cadets must complete at least 1 semester or 2 quarters in the POC to be commissioned through AFROTC.

+ 4.26.3.2. One additional POC term for a former senior division Army or Naval ROTC cadet who was disenrolled after successful completion of at least one academic term of the final year of senior division ROTC. Former Army or Naval ROTC cadets must complete at least 1 semester or 2 quarters in the AFROTC POC to be commissioned through AFROTC. If an ROTC cadet from another service has not spent a minimum of 1 semester or 2 quarters in the AFROTC POC, then the cadet must use the procedures contained in Chapter 12 of this instruction (AF Appointment of ROTC graduates from another Service).

#### 4.27.{#4_27} Pursuing Student.

##### 4.27.1.{#4_27_1} Pursuing students are non-contract POC members who:

+ 4.27.1.1. Hold an EA.

+ 4.27.1.2. Have attended FT or have been properly deferred.

+ 4.27.1.3. Are temporarily ineligible to enlist because of a condition that is expected to be corrected within one academic term.

	+ 4.27.1.3.1. Exception: Guard and Reserve members wishing to retain that status may remain noncontract cadets until approximately 30 days prior to commissioning with a Conditional Release (DD Form 368, Request for Conditional Release) from their unit commander valid through the expected contracting date.

+ 4.27.1.4. Have enrolled in AS300 or 400 class and LLAB.

+ 4.27.1.5. Are full-time students.

##### 4.27.2.{#4_27_2} Detachment Commanders may authorize POC applicants a maximum of one term of pursuing status.

##### 4.27.3.{#4_27_3} Pursuing status is effective the first day of host institution classes.

##### 4.27.4.{#4_27_4} Pursuing students must be enlisted into the POC either within 1 academic term or within 10 workdays of the next term. If unable to enlist, an extension may be requested through the AFROTC Region Commander.

Ensure effective dates are accurately reflected on the AFROTC Form 16. If not enlisted or approved for a second term of pursuing status, "Det Drop" the cadet from WINGS and notify AFROTC/RRFA that the EA is no longer needed.

----

#### 4.28.{#4_28} Extended and Completed Cadets (AS700, AS800, and AS900).

##### 4.28.1.{#4_28_1} AS700 and AS800 are Extended cadets who have successfully completed all AS classes but have not yet finished degree requirements.

+ 4.28.1.1. An AS700 is a non-scholarship cadet. AS700 cadets may receive up to 900 days of stipend if in a SAF-approved 5-Year major.

+ 4.28.1.2. An AS800 is a scholarship cadet in a SAF approved 5-Year major who is still eligible for additional scholarship entitlements and stipend.

+ 4.28.1.3. Extended cadets must continue to participate in LLAB at a level determined by the Detachment Commander, maintain AFROTC military and academic retention standards, and continue to receive a term review each term.

+ 4.28.1.4. Extended cadets are authorized only 1 academic year in extended status— no exceptions.

+ 4.28.1.5. An extended cadet is entitled to certain cadet benefits (for example, space available travel).

+ 4.28.1.7. Use the AFROTC Form 16 to place cadets in extended status.

##### 4.28.4.{#4_28_4} Completed cadets (AS900) have completed all AFROTC and graduation requirements and are awaiting commissioning due to a delay. The most common cause for AS900 status is a nurse awaiting their NCLEX.

+ 4.28.2.1. AS900 cadets are not required to attend AS classes or LLAB.

+ 4.28.2.2. AS900 cadets DO need to complete all pre-commissioning requirements on time.

----

#### 4.29.{#4_29} Transfer of AFROTC Cadets.

##### 4.29.1.{#4_29_1} Transfer of GMC Cadets.

+ 4.29.1.1. Inter-Service Transfer. A non-scholarship GMC cadet may transfer to Army or Naval ROTC if accepted by the PMS or PNS. Update a "Det Drop" in WINGS. A member of the Army (AROTC) or Naval (NROTC) equivalent of the GMC may transfer to the GMC if qualified for membership. Add them to WINGS for proper accountability.

+ 4.29.1.2. Scholarship GMC Cadet Inter-Service Transfer. Since GMC cadets are only contracted when on scholarship, AFROTC/RRF must approve conditional release of contract cadets to AROTC or NROTC. Submit requests for conditional release via AFROTC Form 22 to AFROTC/RRFA and include the written letter of acceptance from the PMS or PNS. If approved, the cadet may enlist in AROTC or NROTC and their AFROTC scholarships will be terminated.

	+ 4.26.1.2.1. Complete the non-investigative disenrollment case file (reference Chapter 11).

	+ 4.29.1.2.2. Stop pay according to HOLMCENTERI 65-101, AFROTC Cadet Payment Programs.

+ 4.29.1.3. Contract cadets accepted to the USAFA are automatically approved for conditional release from AFROTC pending enlistment at USAFA. Upon verification of enlistment, the following actions are required:

	+ 4.29.1.3.1. Complete the non-investigative disenrollment case file (reference Chapter 11).

	+ 4.29.1.3.2. Stop pay according to HOLMCENTERI65-101, AFROTC Cadet Payment Programs.

+ 4.29.1.4. AFROTC Transfer. Non-scholarship GMC cadets may transfer to another AFROTC detachment. The gaining detachment will request all pertinent cadet records and a recommendation for continued membership. The losing detachment completes the transfer by updating WINGS.

	+ 4.29.1.4.1. If a cadet elects to transfer to another school hosting AFROTC before being contracted, the following procedures apply:

	+ 4.29.1.2.4. The EA transfers with the student.

	+ 4.29.1.4.3. The losing detachment completes the transfer by updating WINGS.

##### 4.29.2.{#4_29_2} Scholarship Cadet Transfers. General Policy. Scholarship cadets or selectees may not transfer between institutions without prior approval of the losing Detachment Commander. If the losing detachment determines a cadet has already transferred to another school prior to obtaining approval, the losing detachment will immediately temporarily inactivate the scholarship and investigate for disenrollment.

+ 4.29.2.1. The school to which the cadet wants to transfer must be affiliated with AFROTC.

+ 4.29.2.2. For scholarship cadets in technical majors, the transfer school must have an approved program in the same major.

+ 4.29.2.3. The cadet must complete an academic plan and have this plan approved by the new detachment and institution prior to the losing Detachment Commander authorizing the transfer request.

+ 4.29.2.4. If the transfer moves the DOC/DOG into a different fiscal year, the losing Detachment Commander must request approval of the change and the transfer via an AFROTC Form 22 package to AFROTC/RRFA.

+ 4.29.2.5.{#4_292_5} If a transfer is approved, an activated scholarship will be capped at the tuition rate of the lower cost school regardless of the scholarship type. (For example, if a cadet starts at a school with tuition of $5,000 per year and then transfers to one with tuition at $12,000 per year, the scholarship is capped at $5,000 per year). Exception: If the transfer involves a GMC scholarship selectee, he/she may activate a scholarship while attending a 2-year junior or community college, provided the following:

	+ 4.29.2.5.1. The GMC selectee's academic plan must reflect attendance at both schools. The academic program must be authorized under a formal matriculation agreement (frequently known as "2+2" agreements) between the community/junior college and the senior institution and be listed in the catalog of either institution as a transfer program. Under these agreements, all courses from the community/junior college transfer to the senior institution and meet degree or graduation requirements for a 4-year degree. In addition, the community/junior college must have a cross- town or consortium agreement with AFROTC and the senior institution.

	+ 4.29.1.5.2. The GMC cadet must sign a statement agreeing to transfer to the 4- year baccalaureate degree granting institution as reflected in the approved academic plan and which is affiliated with the same AFROTC detachment as the community/junior college the cadet attends. This transfer request is consummated with the student activating the scholarship at the community/junior college. No AFROTC Form 22 action is required.

	+ 4.29.2.5.3. The tuition will be capped at the programmed 4-year institution's cost.

	+ 4.29.2.5.4. If the scholarship is dependent upon the status of the 2-year institution (e.g., HBCU), and the 4-year institution is not the same status, then the scholarship will be lost upon transfer. These cadets may compete during ICSP Phase 2--this is an exception to the normal policy that does not permit current scholarship cadets to compete. The cadet will not be disenrolled at the conclusion of the AS200 year since they will be eligible for POC entry after successful completion of FT (or appropriate deferral). Suspend scholarship and terminate upon POC entry. Upon entry to an AFROTC-affiliated 4-year institution, the AF Form 1056 will be changed to reflect the loss of the HBCU/HSI scholarship, and, if applicable, activation of a new ICSP scholarship. Loss of an HBCU/HSI scholarship under these circumstances will not normally result in adverse action (e.g., recoupment) unless specific details warrant such action.

+ 4.29.2.6. If a transfer is approved, the losing detachment will:

	+ 4.29.2.6.1. Prepare a statement of scholarship and subsistence entitlements received and include it with the records forwarded to the gaining detachment.

	+ 4.29.2.6.2. Forward the cadet's UPRG to the gaining detachment. Do not allow the cadet to hand carry the UPRG.

	+ 4.29.2.6.3. Ensure WINGS is updated to reflect the transfer.

	+ 4.29.2.6.4. If notified by the gaining detachment that the cadet did not enroll in AS classes, initiate an investigation for disenrollment. Although the cadet UPRG may have been forwarded to the gaining detachment, absolute responsibility and control for continued participation in the AFROTC program is vested with the losing detachment. Any administrative action relative to a cadet's continued participation remains the responsibility of the losing detachment until the gaining detachment submits the necessary changes.

+ 4.29.2.7. When notified of a pending transfer, the gaining detachment will: 4.29.2.7.1. Request the losing detachment forward the cadet's UPRG.

	+ 4.29.2.7.2. Verify that losing Detachment Commander approved a request for transfer in writing.

	+ 4.29.2.7.3. Notify the losing detachment in writing of a cadet's enrollment status in AFROTC classes on the first day of institutional classes.

	+ 4.29.2.7.4. Update WINGS. Ensure "School of Primary Attendance" is updated.

	+ 4.29.7.2.5. Each term of scholarship entitlements, ensure that the transferred cadet is receiving scholarship money at the properly capped amount.

##### 4.29.3.{#4_29_3} National Student Exchange (NSE). Contract cadets may transfer from one detachment to another to participate in NSE with the concurrence of both the losing and gaining commanders. Participating cadets are limited to exchange terms only between institutions with affiliated AFROTC programs. Scholarship cadets assume responsibility for any costs, including tuition and fees, which are over and above those they would have incurred through normal enrollment at the losing institution. The student shall complete a statement of understanding in the format outlined in Figure 4.3. Upon completion of the NSE program, the cadet will transfer back to the original detachment. Figure 4.3. National Student Exchange (NSE) Program Statement of Understanding.

##### 4.29.4.{#4_29_4} Transfer of POC Cadets

+ 4.29.4.1. Inter-Service Transfer:

	+ 4.29.4.1.1. Transfer from the AROTC or NROTC to AFROTC. A contracted AROTC or NROTC cadet may transfer to AFROTC subject to the written approval of the PMS or PNS and the AFROTC Detachment Commander. Prior to transfer, forward requests for an EA via AFROTC Form 22 to AFROTC/RRFA and include a copy of the conditional release from NROTC or AROTC.

	+ 4.29.4.1.2. Transfer from AFROTC to AROTC, NROTC, or USAFA. AFROTC/RRF must approve conditional release of contract cadets to AROTC and NROTC. Submit requests via AFROTC Form 22 to HQ AFROTC/RRFP and include the written acceptance from the PMS or PNS. If HQ AFROTC approves the conditional release, the cadet may enlist in AROTC or NROTC. Contract cadets accepted to the USAFA are automatically approved for conditional release from AFROTC pending enlistment at USAFA. Upon verification of enlistment, the following actions are required:

		+ 4.29.4.1.2.1. Complete the non-investigative disenrollment case file in accordance with Chapter 11.

		+ 4.29.4.1.2.2. Stop pay according to HOLMCENTERI 65-101.

		+ 4.29.4.1.2.3. Notify AFPC/DPSIP if an AFROTC Form 53, Cadet Assignment Preference Worksheet, has been submitted.

	+ 4.29.4.1.3. Transfer of Extended Cadets. An extended cadet may transfer to or from AFROTC in order to accept a direct appointment and commission as directed by Chapter 12.

+ 4.29.4.2. Transfer of POC cadets between AFROTC detachments. Non-scholarship POC cadets may transfer between detachments with the agreement of both commanders.

	+ 4.29.4.2.1. Actions by the losing detachment:

		+ 4.29.4.2.1.1. Upon receipt of notification from the gaining detachment that the cadet is attending institutional and AFROTC classes, the following actions are required:

		+ 4.29.4.2.1.2. Provide the gaining detachment with a statement of subsistence entitlement received.

		+ 4.29.4.2.1.3. Forward the cadet's UPRG to the gaining detachment. 4.29.4.2.1.4. Update WINGS.

		+ 4.29.4.2.1.4. If notified by the gaining detachment that the cadet did not enroll in an AS class, LLAB, and institutional classes as a full-time student, initiate a disenrollment investigation.

		+ 4.29.4.2.1.5. If the transfer moves the DOC/DOG into a different fiscal year, the losing Detachment Commander must request approval of the change and the transfer via an AFROTC Form 22 package to AFROTC/RRFA.

	+ 4.29.4.2.2. Actions by the gaining detachment:

		+ 4.29.4.2.2.1. Review the new academic plan and verify the cadet has been accepted by the institution in the academic major in which the cadet is currently contracted. Use of college academic advisors to verify the academic plan is highly encouraged.

		+ 4.29.4.2.2.2. Verify with the losing detachment that the fiscal year of commissioning indicated on the AF Form 1056 is consistent with the DOG and DOC indicated on the academic plan and can be met at the institution.

		+ 4.29.4.2.2.3. Ensure the cadet is enrolled in an AS class, LLAB, and institutional classes as a full-time student.

		+ 4.29.4.2.2.4. If a cadet does not enroll in an AS class, LLAB, and institutional classes as a full-time student in the currently contracted academic major by the first day of institutional classes, notify the losing detachment. Responsibility and control for the continued participation in the AFROTC program is vested with the losing detachment. Any administrative action relative to a cadet's continued participation remains the responsibility of the losing detachment.

		+ 4.29.4.2.2.5. Update WINGS. Ensure "School of Primary Attendance" is updated.

#### 4.30.{#4_30} Cadet Counseling Requirements and Term Reviews.

##### 4.30.4.{#4_30_4} General. Counseling provides the means to review performance and to ensure a cadet understands retention and scholarship standards, scholarship entitlements (if applicable), and the consequences should these standards not be met. These sessions provide an opportunity to mentor the cadet, identify positive performance areas, review deficiencies in the cadet's performance as they relate to contracting eligibility or scholarships, and to motivate the cadet to take action to improve performance. Counseling provides the necessary documentation trail should adverse actions such as dismissal (det drop), scholarship suspension, termination, or disenrollment from AFROTC become necessary. Use the AFROTC Form 16 to document each counseling session. Term reviews are counseling.

##### 4.30.5.{#4_30_5} For any situation that could adversely affect a cadet's continuation in the program, or place a cadet's scholarship or stipend in jeopardy, the detachment must take immediate action to notify and counsel the cadet. Use all means available to contact the student and document these attempts in the UPRG. It is especially important when issuing a Conditional Event to counsel immediately so the rehabilitative qualities can take effect and government financial liability for tuition is suspended immediately if warranted. A CE for poor grades in the spring term is of diminished value if the detachment waits until fall term counseling to tell the cadet that their scholarship is at risk if the fall term grades are poor. Detachments also cannot wait until the 45th day of the fall term or the 1st day of the spring term to tell the cadet that they will not be funded that term due to multiple CEs, substandard GPA, or suspended scholarship. Pecuniary liability commences on the 45th day of the fall term and the first day of winter/spring terms.

##### 4.30.6.{#4_30_6} Detachment personnel MUST review grades at the end of each term (quarter or semester) to ensure AFROTC academic standards are met and award appropriate CEs during a counseling session. Do not wait for Midterm Counseling. See previous paragraph regarding adverse situations.

##### 4.30.7.{#4_30_7} Detachment Pay Monitor must initial and Detachment Commander must sign all AFROTC Forms 16s affecting tuition or stipend.

##### 4.30.8.{#4_30_8} Counseling Scholarship Cadets and Selectees.

+ 4.30.8.1. Counseling must occur for scholarship activation, declination, temporary inactivation, suspension, reactivation, and termination (if applicable), (reference Chapter 3).

+ 4.30.8.2. Cadets who decline their scholarship, before or after activation, must sign a statement on an AFROTC Form 16 declining the scholarship. Include the statement in the cadet's UPRG.

+ 4.30.8.3. Ensure each cadet currently in a SAF-approved 5-year major, who obtains approval for a major change, understands that scholarship entitlement ends upon completion of AFROTC classes (AS400), unless their new major is also a SAF- approved 5-year major and they are approved for extended entitlements.

##### 4.30.9.{#4_30_9} Ensure each cadet currently in a SAF-approved 5-year major, who obtains approval of a major change to a non-SAF-approved 5-year major, understands that stipend is restricted to 600 days in the POC and, therefore, will possibly terminate before completion of degree.

##### 4.30.10.{#4_30_10} Midterm reviews. Officers must counsel each contract cadet at least once each fall term and at least once each winter or spring term. Term counseling for non-contract cadets is highly encouraged but not mandatory. The thoroughness and accuracy of term reviews are important in determining a cadet's academic progression. Complete midterm reviews by the midpoint of the term. If midterm grades are accessible, perform counseling within two weeks after grades are received.

+ 4.30.10.1. During midterm reviews for all cadets, officers will:

	+ 4.30.10.1.1. Ensure a cadet understands academic, military, and medical retention standards, and the consequences should these standards not be met.

	+ 4.30.10.1.2. Review the cadet's performance during the most recently completed term, as well as progress during the cadet's tenure in AFROTC. Mentor the cadet, identify positive performance areas, review deficiencies in the cadet's performance as they relate to contracting eligibility or scholarships, and motivate the cadet to take action to improve performance. If the cadet's performance is deficient, the counselor must document and recommend specific actions and provide a plan for improvement.

	+ 4.30.10.1.3. Ensure each cadet understands that changing an academic major must be coordinated with cadre; cadre must pre-approve major changes for cadets. Failure to do so may result in diminished opportunities for an EA or scholarships, scholarship termination, withdrawal of the scholarship offer, or disenrollment from AFROTC.

	+ 4.30.10.1.4. Ensure each cadet understands that transferring to another college or university must be pre-approved by the losing Detachment Commander (ref. para 4.29) and, for a scholarship cadet, the tuition will be capped at the rate of the lower cost institution.

	+ 4.30.10.1.5. Verify commissioning FY and academic major annotated on the AF Form 1056 matches information listed on the Student Management Roster (SMR) and the academic plan. Crosscheck that the university transcript shows the same major.

	+ 4.30.10.1.6. Conduct an AFROTC Form 48 Academic Plan Review.

		+ 4.30.10.1.6.1. Cadet's first term in AFROTC. Review the draft Form 48 and advise the cadet as necessary on how to complete the form and obtain a university official's signature. If the Form 48 has been university-approved in Block 4, sign in Block 5, AFROTC official review, to complete the initial Form 48. Don't forget to date the signatures.

		+ 4.30.10.1.6.2. Cadet's second term in AFROTC. Review the Form 48 to confirm university certification in Block 4. If none exists, verify that there is a memorandum stating that the academic advisor refused to sign IAW Attachment 15. If no memo exists, inquire with the cadet the reason for the missing signature. If there is a memo, cadre should use the university catalog for the academic degree to assist with the review to ensure Form 48 courses satisfy graduation requirements. Sign Block 5 if not already done in order to complete the initial Form 48.

		+ 4.30.10.1.6.3. Cadet's third and subsequent terms. Follow the procedures below:

		+ 4.30.10.1.6.3.1. Review the cadet's academic performance towards meeting degree requirements during the previous term and annotate the cadet's academic plan. Using the cadet's grade report or transcript, ensure the cadet has made acceptable academic progress, annotate the "Credit Hours Completed" (if no credit is given for a class enter "0"), and any "deviations." Use the "deviations" block to identify academic plan deviations normally resulting from substandard academic performance. Enter "F" for course failure (or equivalent), "I" for incomplete, "W" for course withdrawals, or "NC" for course not creditable towards degree requirements. If a cadet receives an "F" (or equivalent) in or withdraws from a required course, add the course to a future term and strike through it in the previous term. Since the entry is self-explanatory, no remarks are required. If a course change results from other factors, such as classes are full, student prefers to take a different class than originally planned, etc., simply line through and enter the new course. Do not enter deviation codes for such entries.

		+ 4.30.10.1.6.3.2 Review the cadet's academic plan for the current term. Ensure the cadet is enrolled in the courses listed on the academic plan and that the cadet is a full-time student. Term reviews are considered complete when the "Student" and "Reviewer" enter their signatures (in ink) in the applicable blocks of the academic plan for the current term and an AFROTC Form 16 is signed. Maintain the transcript or grade report used during this review in the cadet's UPRG until a more current transcript is received.

+ 4.30.10.3. During midterm reviews for all scholarship cadets, officers will:

	+ 4.30.10.3.1. Ensure a cadet understands academic, military, and medical standards for scholarship retention, and the consequences should these standards not be met. Reference Table 4.1 and 4.2.

	+ 4.30.10.3.2. Ensure each freshman HSSP cadet or selectee (4-year or 3-year) understands that he/she must complete the academic plan NLT the last day of the first term of their freshman year.

	+ 4.30.10.3.3. Ensure each scholarship cadet understands that summer school and mini-sessions are not normal terms of entitlement. Substandard performance in such coursework could adversely affect scholarship retention if CGPA falls below standards.

	+ 4.30.10.3.4. Counsel all scholarship cadets seeking an EA that if they do not compete favorably in PSP, an investigation for disenrollment will be initiated. Meeting minimum scholarship retention standards does not guarantee the cadet an EA.

----

#### 4.31.{#4_31} Scholarship Retention Standards.

Cadets must maintain scholarship retention standards in order to be in good academic standing in AFROTC. These standards include, but are not limited to, minimum TGPA of 2.5 and full-time student status. Any course failures, or course grades which require retaking the course for degree credit are handled in accordance with Table 4.2. NOTE: Except where otherwise indicated, these standards also apply for summer terms and mini-sessions when funded by AFROTC.

----

#### 4.32.{#4_32} Academic Retention Standards.

##### 4.32.1.{#4_32_1} Cadets must maintain academic and military retention standards as specified below:

+ 4.32.1.1. Academic retention standards are those minimum institutional grade requirements and AFROTC grade requirements needed for retention in the AFROTC program or retention of a scholarship. Failure to meet academic retention standards could result in an investigation for disenrollment.

+ 4.32.1.2. For minimum GPA and grade requirements for scholarship cadets refer to Attachment 12. All GMC cadets (scholarship and non-scholarship) must meet military and academic retention requirements for the PSP prior to submission for an EA (Attachment 12 and Chapter 8).

+ 4.32.1.3. At institutions where transfer credits and/or AS classes are not recognized as part of the GPA, complete the GPA calculation.

+ 4.32.1.4. Grade Requirements.

	+ 4.32.1.4.1. Cadets must receive a grade of "C-" or better in AS classes and LLAB. If LLAB is graded on a Pass/Fail system, cadets must receive a passing grade. When the cadet receives a grade of "D" or "F" in AS class or LLAB, the cadet must be investigated for disenrollment (contract cadets) or dismissed from the program (non- contract cadets). Cadets who fail AS class and/or LLAB are not authorized to return to AFROTC.

	+ 4.32.1.4.2. Contract cadets who receive a final grade of "F" or the institutional equivalent in a single academic term are not maintaining AFROTC academic retention standards and must receive a CE. See paragraph 4.38 and Table 4.2. NOTE: In situations where the Detachment Commander feels further information regarding the failure is warranted, AFROTC Form 704, Academic Performance Inquiry, may be used to obtain information from academic instructors regarding the AFROTC cadet's academic efforts in courses in which academic standards have not been met.

	+ 4.32.1.4.3. For contract cadets only, any grade which requires a course to be retaken for degree accreditation is considered an "F equivalent." For example, if a grade of "D" in a senior-level core course is not acceptable for the degree and must be retaken, it is a failure to maintain academic standards (reference Table 4.1 and 4.2). Additionally, if a cadet fails a class needed to meet a requirement and has to repeat a class of any type to meet that requirement, even if another class is taken, then issue a CE. NOTE: A CE is not required for courses taken during summer or mini-sessions not funded by AFROTC; however, summer and mini-session GPAs will be computed into the AFROTC CGPA. Multiple course failures which occur during the same semester warrant only one CE.

	+ 4.32.1.4.4. Incomplete Grades. For contract cadets only, an "I" (incomplete) or its equivalent (e.g., "DF," Deferred) is a failure to meet academic standards and warrants a CE. In the rare cases where the "I" is the result of circumstances beyond the cadet's control, for example poor weather for flying classes or not enough flyable aircraft for all students, the CE should be waived. Incompletes due to insufficient classroom performance or missing homework or exams definitely warrant a CE. In all cases, monitor the "I" until there is resolution and a final grade has been awarded. Even if the class is completed with a passing grade, the CE still stands. Counsel via AFROTC Form 16.

	+ 4.32.1.4.5. Summer or mini-session terms are not considered a "regular" term unless scholarship payment is authorized. Detachments will review and take action any time a cadet receiving summer entitlements fails to meet applicable academic standards (reference Table 4.1 and 4.2).

		+ 4.32.1.4.5.1. Do not issue a CE for these terms unless the cadet received scholarship payment for that term.

		+ 4.32.1.4.5.2. For scholarship activation, the summer or mini term cumulative GPA must be used to determine scholarship activation. For example, a cadet has an HSSP 3-year Type 2 scholarship with fall term activation, but their freshman spring term CGPA is below 2.5 due to a poor first term in college, then this scholarship cannot be activated. If the cadet completes a summer term and brings their CGPA above the 2.5 requirement, scholarship activation is authorized in the fall term. Conversely, if a scholarship cadet recipient has a CGPA of 2.50 at the end of the spring term, completes a summer term which drops the CGPA below 2.50, the scholarship cannot be activated at that time.

	+ 4.32.1.4.6. Timely grade changes based on mistakes or a reevaluation by an instructor should be accepted. Commanders should not consider grade changes done after a cadet's initial failure to complete academic responsibilities. In such cases, use the initial grade to determine appropriate actions. Also, use the initially- issued GPA for the next term. For subsequent terms, use the GPA on the transcripts. Document all grade changes and maintain in the cadet's records for the life of the UPRG.

	+ 4.32.1.4.7. AFROTC will not recognize GPAs based on non-traditional grading programs such as "forgiveness," "grade substitution," or "grade exclusion" rules. For example, some institutions may allow students to drop low or failing grades without calculating them into the TGPA or CGPA. Others may allow the student to retake a class and recalculate the GPAs based only on the new grade(s). AFROTC factors ALL college grades into the CGPA.

		+ 4.32.1.4.7.1 Detachments will use all postsecondary course grades in determining a cadet's qualifications for program entry, retention, scholarship, enrollment allocation, and special categorization boards. Detachments will calculate term TGPA and CGPA based on all college courses taken. Documentation for these calculations must be maintained in the cadet record for the duration of the cadet's tenure in AFROTC.

		+ 4.32.1.4.7.2 For cadets transferring in from another university, detachments will calculate the CGPA to include all previously attempted course work whether or not accepted for transfer credit. Be careful NOT to include graded transfer credit twice. For example, a cadet transfers in from another university. The new university accepts 20 of the cadet's 50 hours in transfer and includes the grade on the new university's transcript. Do NOT include those 20 hours of graded transfers a second time. Some universities just give credit for the class without associating a grade with it. In such a case, all 50 hours would be calculated into the AFROTC CGPA.

	+ 4.32.1.4.8. Non-Line Cadets. Pre-health and dental candidates must maintain a CGPA of 3.30 or higher based on a 4.0 scale in their major to maintain their non-line EA. Detachments must request a category change for cadets who do not meet CGPA requirement. If HQ AFROTC/RRFP cannot allocate a tech or non-tech EA to the cadet, the Detachment Commander must initiate an investigation for disenrollment.

	+ 4.32.1.4.9. All GPAs are based on the A = 4.00 scale. When applying GPA standards throughout this instruction, use the most recent TGPA and cumulative ROTC- calculated CGPA. If AFROTC course grades are not included, calculate the GPAs to include them.

	+ 4.32.1.4.10. Advance placement credit may not be used to recalculate GPA unless the course was taken at an accredited college or university and a letter grade was awarded.

	+ 4.32.1.4.11. Round all GPAs to the nearest hundredth if they are reported to more significant digits by the institution (e.g., 2.495 rounds to 2.50 and 2.494 rounds to 2.49).

	+ 4.32.1.4.12. Full-Time Student. GMC / POC members must be full-time students at the host school or a combination of the host school and an institution having a cross- town or consortium arrangement (except during summer terms). The number of credit hours required for full-time student status during any academic term is the minimum number specified in the institutional catalog. NOTE: A cadet is NOT required to maintain full-time status their final term.

		+ 4.32.1.4.12.1. If the institution does not specify a full-time enrollment, AFROTC specifies a minimum of 12 hours of undergraduate level courses or 9 hours of graduate level courses except during summer terms, including AFROTC courses.

		+ 4.32.1.4.12.2. Failed courses do not constitute dropping below full-time status.

	+ 4.32.1.4.13. Non-Traditional Courses. Correspondence, independent study, TV, internet, or other means of non-traditional courses may count toward the minimum number of credit hours which must be taken to qualify as a full-time student. AFROTC places great emphasis on the classroom environment. Detachment Commanders must monitor the use of non-traditional courses to ensure cadets are maximizing the traditional course opportunities. To make a determination, the detachment must verify:

		+ 4.32.1.4.13.1. Course is accepted, accredited, and graded by the university the cadet is attending.

		+ 4.32.1.4.13.2. Not more than five non-traditional courses in any one academic year.

		+ 4.32.1.4.13.3. Cadets cannot take more than three non-traditional courses in any single term without AFROTC/RR waiver.

	+ 4.32.1.4.14. Audit courses do not count toward the minimum number of credit hours that must be taken to qualify as a full-time student.

	+ 4.32.1.4.15. Classes taken at an institution that does not have a cross-town or consortium agreement may count towards full-time student status if the university is an accredited institution and the cadet/applicant is properly registered for AFROTC classes at the host institution.

	+ 4.32.1.4.16. Repeat coursework counts toward full-time student status. NOTE: AFROTC will NOT pay for courses repeated.

	+ 4.32.1.4.17. If a contract cadet fails to maintain full-time student status prior to their final term, award a CE as prescribed in Table 4.2.

#### 4.33.{#4_33} Date of Graduation (DOG) and Date of Commission (DOC).

##### 4.33.1.{#4_33_1} Cadets must commission in the fiscal year (FY) stated on their AF Form 1056. When a cadet cannot meet a scheduled DOG and DOC for any reason, the detachment must take immediate action to change the DOG and DOC or investigate for disenrollment. NOTE: Detachments must notify AFPC when a DOC/DOG change occurs after submission of the AFROTC Form 53 (reference Chapter 12).

##### 4.33.2.{#4_33_2} Prior to submitting a contracted cadet for an EA, the Detachment Commander may approve a DOC/DOG change into a new fiscal year provided doing so does not put the cadet in completed status for more than one year and does not change the FY of a major predicated on the specific FY (e.g., EXPRESS scholarships). During this same period, Detachment Commanders may approve an initial change from an 0GYY (General Studies) scholarship, awarded through ICSP, to a specific major as declared by the cadet. Detachment Commanders will ensure that WINGS reflects the correct DOC/DOG or major prior to submitting the cadet for an EA. Post-PSP DOC/DOG changes to a new fiscal year require an AFROTC Form 22 to AFROTC/RRFP. Once a major is changed from 0GYY to a specific major, any additional major changes must comply with procedures established below. For approved changes, update the AF Form 1056 change page to reflect the new major and/or FY (see Attachment 17).

##### 4.33.3.{#4_33_3} If a cadet already has an EA, the Detachment Commander may approve a DOC/DOG change delay to a later date in the same fiscal year. DOC/DOG changes to an earlier month within the same fiscal year and within one year of DOC must be approved by AFROTC/RRF to ensure that the cadet is properly scrolled for commissioning. If the new DOC is more than one year from the date of submission, detachment commanders may request the change via Trouble Ticket, providing the change does not result in less than two years in the POC. (Reference Chapter 3 for scholarship entitlements and AFI 36-2013 for POC-ERP students).

----

#### 4.34.{#4_34} Academic Major.

##### 4.34.1.{#4_34_1} Cadets must graduate in the academic major stated on their AF Form 1056. When cadets cannot continue in their contracted academic major or when cadets desire to change academic majors, including cadets requesting major changes after submitting for an EA, the following apply:

+ 4.34.1.1. Detachment Commanders can approve major changes from non-technical to non-technical within the programmed fiscal year. If the request would move the projected DOC/DOG into a different fiscal year, the commander must submit an AFROTC Form 22 to AFROTC/RRFA. The exception to this authority is when the initial non-technical major was a pre-requisite for a scholarship (e.g., Nurse or Foreign Language scholarships).

+ 4.34.1.2. If the cadet is a scholarship cadet, the new major must be on the list of approved majors for scholarships.

+ 4.34.1.3. Detachment Commanders can approve major changes from non-technical to technical within the programmed fiscal year. If the request would move the projected DOC/DOG into a different fiscal year, the commander must submit an AFROTC Form 22 to AFROTC/RRFA.

+ 4.34.1.4. Detachment Commanders can approve major changes from technical to technical within the programmed fiscal year for non-scholarship cadets. Submit a WINGS Trouble Ticket requesting the change.

+ 4.34.1.5. Any major change not within the Detachment Commander's approval authority requires approval prior to the cadet changing majors. Submit an AFROTC Form 22 to AFROTC/RRFA.

+ 4.34.1.6. Upon approval of a major change request, verify WINGS has been updated and if not, forward the change via a trouble ticket through WINGS.

+ 4.34.1.7. Non-Line ONLY. Any non-line cadet requesting an academic major change that will alter the status of their present or upcoming contracted category or DOC/DOG must be approved by AFROTC/RRF via an AFROTC Form 22 request.

+ 4.34.1.8. Detachments must notify AFPC when a DOC/DOG change occurs after submission of the AFROTC Form 53 (reference Chapter 12).

##### 4.34.2.{#4_34_2} Scholarship Cadet Academic Major Changes. This section applies only to scholarship cadets and selectees. All HSSP scholarship cadets must declare their academic major NLT the first day of their AS200 classes. Technical academic majors (as indicated on the original scholarship offer) must remain technical. Non-technical majors can remain non- technical or may be switched to technical.

+ 4.34.2.1. When they wish to request an academic major change, scholarship selectees fall into four main categories. Follow the procedures based on the appropriate category.

	+ 4.34.2.1.1. Category 1: HSSP Scholarship Selectee, Prior to Start of Classes Freshman Year. The cadet must formally request a change via letter to AFROTC/RRUC. They must present a formal approval response from AFROTC/RRUC to their detachment prior to activating their scholarship and signing a contract (AF Form 1056).

	+ 4.34.2.1.2. Category 2: HSSP Scholarship Selectee, After Start of Classes but Prior to Scholarship Activation. The cadet must follow the same guidelines as Category 4 cadets.

	+ 4.34.2.1.3. Category 3: Scholarship Cadets on Contract or With an EA. If an ICSP scholarship selectee has not yet activated their scholarship, but they have received an EA, or if a scholarship cadet (regardless of scholarship source) has activated their scholarship and they are now on contract, they will follow the guidelines in this category. Detachment Commanders will adhere to the following guidelines when considering academic major changes within this category, as described in the following paragraph:

		+ 4.34.2.1.3.1. A cadet's request to change majors from a SAF-approved 5- year major to a non-SAF-approved 5-year major must be approved through AFROTC/RRFA. If approved, counsel the cadet via AFROTC Form 16 that scholarship funding will end upon entering completed status.

		+ 4.34.2.1.3.2. Ensure the cadet completes an academic plan in the new major prior to Detachment Commander approval of the major change or submission of the request to AFROTC/RRFP.

		+ 4.34.2.1.3.3. Detachment Commanders can approve major changes from non- technical to non-technical within the programmed fiscal year. The new major must be on the list of approved majors for scholarships, i.e. mandatory or desired for line officer AFSCs. If the request will move the projected DOC/DOG into a different fiscal year or if the cadet's scholarship is specifically tied to a major (e.g. FLEX, Nurse, Foreign Language, Critical Technical, etc.), the commander must submit an AFROTC Form 22 and receive written approval from AFROTC/RRF.

		+ 4.34.2.1.3.4. Detachment Commanders can approve major changes from non- technical to technical within the programmed fiscal year. If the request will move the projected DOC/DOG into a different fiscal year, the commander must submit an AFROTC Form 22, and receive approval from AFROTC/RRF. NOTE: Detachments should call AFROTC/RRFA to request cadet's categorization be updated in WINGS from "Officer (N)" to "Officer (T)."

		+ 4.34.2.1.3.5. Detachment Commanders can approve major changes from technical to technical within the programmed fiscal year. If the request will move the projected DOC/DOG into a different fiscal year or if the scholarship is specifically tied to a major or DOC/DOG (e.g., EXPRESS, FLEX, Critical Technical, Foreign Language, etc.) the commander must submit an AFROTC Form 22, and receive approval from AFROTC/RRF. After successful completion of their Freshman year, HSSP scholarship cadets may switch to an approved in- college technical major. The list of approved in- college technical majors is available on the Registrar section of the Holm Center restricted website. The request must be made prior to AFSC classification. If after the start of AFSC classification, submit an AFROTC Form 22 to AFROTC/RRFA to request approval.

		+ 4.34.2.1.3.6. Any major change not within the Detachment Commander's approval authority requires approval from AFROTC/RRF prior to the cadet changing majors, including all requests to switch from a technical major to a non- technical major. Specify in the request whether the major change, if approved, would also move the projected DOC/DOG into a different fiscal year. Include the old and the new academic plans with the request.

		+ 4.32.2.1.3.7. Upon approval of a major change request, verify that WINGS has been updated. If not, forward the change via a trouble ticket through WINGS.

	+ 4.32.2.1.4. Category 4: ICSP Scholarship Selectee, Prior to EA and Scholarship Activation. Cadets must notify their detachment staff and complete all pertinent documentation, especially the academic plan. Formal approval is not required for non-tech to non-tech major changes on the approved list except for foreign language; however, tech to non-tech major changes must be approved by HQ AFROTC/RRUC. The length of the ICSP scholarship offer will not change even if the DOC/DOG changes because the length is predicated on the completion of AS400 classes. The major change could impact the scholarship offer, so the detachment staff should consider and counsel the cadet on the potential impacts to change their academic major.

	+ 4.32.2.1.5. Scholarship cadets must graduate in the academic major stated on their AF Form 1056. Either the Detachment Commander or HQ AFROTC/RRFP must approve all major changes prior to the cadet changing majors. If the detachment determines the cadet has, or may have, already changed majors prior to approval, the detachment will immediately temporarily inactivate the scholarship.

----

#### 4.35.{#4_35} EA/Category.

##### 4.35.1.{#4_35_1} Cadets must be commissioned in the category stated on their AF Form 1056.

##### 4.35.2.{#4_35_2} Additional academic retention standards are required for cadets to retain certain categories. Cadets not meeting the following requirements after award will lose their respective category and must re-compete once eligible. All individuals who lose their category are re-categorized to "Officer Candidate."

+ 4.35.2.1. Pre-Health/Dentistry. Cadets categorized as Pre-Health/Dentistry MUST maintain a CGPA of 3.30 to maintain their pre-health/dental EA. Detachments must request a category change for cadets who do not maintain CGPA minimums. If AFROTC/RRF cannot allocate a tech or non-tech EA to the cadet, the Detachment Commander must initiate an investigation for disenrollment.

+ 4.35.2.2. Biomedical Science Corps (BSC)/Nursing. Cadets categorized in the BSC or Nurse category must maintain good academic standing with the institution.

##### 4.35.3.{#4_35_3} Changes in category require coordination with AFROTC/RRFA. Update the AF Form 1056 using the changes page (reference Attachment 17).

----

#### 4.36.{#4_36} Period of Non-Attendance (PNA) for Contract Cadets Only.

##### 4.36.1.{#4_36_1} PNA is a period of authorized absence from school and/or AS classes and LLAB. Detachment Commanders may authorize up to one term of PNA for mandatory academic absences only (e.g., student teaching requirements, nursing school clinicals, etc.). Adjust academic plan to reflect dual enrollment for one term, if required, to ensure scheduled commissioning date is maintained.4.36.2.1. Approval for any other situation should be requested through AFROTC/RRFA via an AFROTC Form 22, with the exception of church missions which can be handled via trouble ticket. For longer PNAs like church missions, be sure that the DOG is updated in WINGS.

##### 4.36.2.{#4_36_2} Use the AFROTC Form 16 to document PNA status. Counsel the cadet to maintain standards while in PNA status. Cadets PNA for more than one year for non-academic reasons (e.g., 2-year church mission), must be contacted in writing once a term.

----

#### 4.37.{#4_37} Term Abroad Program.

##### 4.37.1.{#4_37_1} Term Abroad refers to terms in which AFROTC is normally offered and therefore represents a potential interruption in AFROTC training. These programs broaden AFROTC cadets experience and help support Air Staff efforts to support an expeditionary Air Force in terms of cultural awareness and language proficiency. The Detachment Commander may approve a term abroad which is mandatory for a degree; however, HQ AFROTC/RR waiver is required if the term abroad is not mandatory and/or extends beyond one term. Cadets attending a term abroad course of study must be placed in Term Abroad status in WINGS.

##### 4.37.2.{#4_37_2} Detachments must maintain phone/email contact with cadet for duration of overseas study. Term counseling must be completed while the cadet is abroad. Ensure the host institution has signed off on the academic plan approving the term abroad as part of the degree curriculum.

##### 4.37.3.{#4_37_3} Cadet must make-up missed AS classes and meet all LLAB requirements. This is usually done by dual enrollment.

##### 4.37.4.{#4_37_4} Coursework must fulfill contracted degree requirements.

##### 4.37.5.{#4_37_5} Participation must not alter the projected DOC/DOG.

##### 4.37.6.{#4_37_6} Scholarship costs will be capped at those costs the cadet would have had at the host institution. The student is responsible for any other costs. The student shall complete a statement of understanding in the format outlined in Figure 4.4. Counsel cadet via AFROTC Form 16 that he/she must maintain retention standards (e.g., fitness, weight, civil involvement, drugs, etc.).

+ 4.37.6.1. There is no Air Force allowance for travel, room, board, or any other costs incurred by the term abroad program.

+ 4.37.6.2. The period of study may not exceed one academic term, unless approved by HQ AFROTC/RRF.

##### 4.37.7.{#4_37_7} Cadets are not authorized term abroad in final term unless approved by HQ AFROTC/RRF.

----

#### 4.38.{#4_38} Conditional Event (CE).

##### 4.38.1.{#4_38_1} A CE is official documentation of a failure to maintain AFROTC retention standards.

##### 4.38.2.{#4_38_2} Detachment Commanders should issue CEs in an effort to adjust cadet behavior and to warn the cadet they are not meeting AFROTC academic or military retention standards. Issue CEs to contract and non-contract cadets per the guidance below. Counsel the cadet via AFROTC Form 16 on the deficiency that resulted in the CE. CEs may be issued any time, regardless of term, a cadet fails to meet a retention standard or if the Detachment Commander deems warranted (e.g., excessive counseling). If a cadet fails to maintain two separate retention factors in a single term, document each incident on a separate AFROTC Form 16. These count as two separate CEs. Reference Tables 4.1 and 4.2 for matrix and schedule for CEs.

+ 4.38.2.1. Contract Cadet CEs. Contract cadets (scholarship and non-scholarship) who fail to maintain retention standards must receive a CE. Scholarship termination or initiation of a disenrollment investigation does not eliminate the requirement to issue the CE. A decision to retain a cadet receiving a fourth, or additional CE does not diminish AFROTC's right to cite the deficiencies as grounds for subsequent disenrollment. ACADEMIC CE EXCEPTION: If a cadet receives more than one failing grade (to include "I" incomplete) in a given term or the term GPA drops below 2.5 as a result of the failing grades in that term, count as only one CE. On the other hand, an "F" grade and less than full-time student status are separate failures and warrant two CEs.

+ 4.38.2.2. Non-Contract Cadet CEs. Detachment/CCs reserve the option to issue CEs to non-contract cadets. This should be considered the most severe warning/counseling for a non-contract cadet. Detachment Commander-issued CEs to non-contract cadets should not be included in the count of CEs that initiate the disenrollment process.

##### 4.38.3.{#4_38_3} HQ-Directed CE. HQ AFROTC can direct a CE to contract and non-contract cadets. If HQ AFROTC directs a CE to a non-contract cadet, it should not be included in the count of CEs that begins the disenrollment process.

##### 4.38.4.{#4_38_4} Conditional Probation. HQ AFROTC may direct a CE with probation period for contract and non-contract cadets.

+ 4.38.4.1. Should a non-contract cadet violate the terms of the probation, dismiss them from the AFROTC program. This does not require HQ AFROTC approval, but must be documented on AFROTC Form 16.

+ 4.38.4.2. Should a contract cadet violate the terms of probation, investigate for disenrollment.

##### 4.38.5.{#4_38_5} Documentation. Use the AFROTC Form 16 to counsel the cadet and to document the award of the CE. Update WINGS. The date of event is the effective date of the CE unless otherwise directed. If a retention failure occurs or is identified after the last day of host institution classes, then the effective date will be the date the grade/CE was earned. If additional time is required for documenting or determining the requirement for a CE, the effective date will be the date of the event that led to the CE.

##### 4.38.6.{#4_38_6} Timing. For maximum rehabilitative effect, CEs should be awarded and documented as soon after earned as possible. The rehabilitative effect is reduced significantly if a cadet is not given a CE for spring term grades until November during the fall term mid-term counseling. It is especially critical when a scholarship suspension (no funding) will result from the CE.

##### 4.38.7.{#4_38_7} Rescinding a CE. Rescission of CEs is an absolute exception and rarely warranted. Region Commanders may rescind a CE only when it was erroneously issued or when serious mitigating circumstances are revealed after the CE is issued. This is specifically NOT for CEs that change in nature after the initial characterization of the event. (I.E. DUI pleads down to lesser offense)

----

#### 4.39.{#4_39} Probation.

##### 4.39.1.{#4_39_1} HQ AFROTC may direct probationary periods with waiver approvals (for example, with a civil involvement waiver approval) or with a disenrollment investigation. The terms of the probation will be outlined with the HQ AFROTC response. For probation resulting from a disenrollment investigation, see Chapter 11.

##### 4.39.2.{#4_39_2} Probation Offer. A cadet offered waiver approval with probation is allowed to continue in the AFROTC program. The cadet must agree to and meet the terms of the probation. Counsel the cadet on their probationary requirements via AFROTC Form 16. Failure to meet the terms of the probation will result in dismissal from the AFROTC program for non-contract cadets and a disenrollment for contract cadets. The terms of the probation can include, but are not limited to, a period of time for watching behavior, civil involvement or alcohol restrictions, alcohol/drug/sexual awareness training class to be paid at the students expense, loss of previously awarded competitive selections (e.g., rated categorization), and/or any other action AFROTC believes will help change or improve cadet behavior.

##### 4.39.3.{#4_39_3} Non-Contract Cadet Probation. Should a non-contract cadet violate the terms of probation for any reason, dismiss the cadet and withdraw the EA (if awarded). Accomplish "Det Drop" in WINGS. HQ AFROTC will not consider additional waiver requests for non- contract cadets who violate the terms of the probation.

##### 4.39.4.{#4_39_4} Contract Cadet Probation. Only in rare circumstances will a contract cadet be granted probation with a waiver request. For contract cadets, a disenrollment investigation will be directed and probation may be the outcome of that investigation. For probation resulting from a disenrollment investigation, see Chapter 11.

Table 4.1. Schedule of Scholarship/Disenrollment Actions for CEs.
The schedule below provides follow-on actions REQUIRED by the detachment based on CEs accumulated by a contract cadet's failure to meet military and/or academic standard(s). This table should be used in conjunction with Table 4.2. Depending on the severity of the behavior that prompted the issuance of the CE even if this is the cadet's first CE, the Detachment Commander or HQ AFROTC (if the Detachment Commander requested a waiver), may direct dismissal or a disenrollment investigation.
Number Contract GMC Cadet POC Cadet
First CE (in GMC
or POC) No suspension required (if reason for CE is severe, Detachment Commander can use discretion and suspend scholarship).

EXCEPTION: Suspend scholarship for cadets who receive a TGPA below 2.0 during any term of scholarship. No suspension required (if reason for CE is severe, Detachment Commander can use discretion and suspend scholarship).

EXCEPTION: Suspend scholarship for cadets who receive a TGPA below 2.0 during any term of scholarship Second CE (in GMC
or POC) Suspend scholarship. Suspend scholarship.
Third CE (in GMC
or in POC) Terminate scholarship; investigate for disenrollment Terminate scholarship; investigate for disenrollment
Two Total CEs Suspend Scholarship
Three Total CEs Terminate Scholarship
Four Total CEs Investigate for disenrollment.

----

#### 4.40.{#4_40} Military Retention Standards.

##### 4.40.1.{#4_40_1} Military retention standards are those standards expected of officer candidates to include, but not limited to, moral character, bearing and behavior, physical fitness, professional conduct and relationships, appearance, meeting contracted retention standards, and other standards as prescribed by Air Force directives. Failure to meet any military retention standard may result in dismissal or investigation for disenrollment.

##### 4.40.2.{#4_40_2} Undesirable Character Traits:

+ 4.40.2.1. Cadets must not possess traits that interfere with their effectiveness and performance as officer candidates. Character traits and personal attributes that detract from the traditional officer values of self-discipline, pride, loyalty, integrity, commitment, and esprit de corps will not be tolerated in cadets.

+ 4.40.2.2. Undesirable character traits are learned attitudes and perspectives, which are difficult to "unlearn." Examples include dishonesty, racism, bigotry, gender chauvinism, etc.

##### 4.40.3.{#4_40_3} Physical Fitness, Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Fat. Contract cadets and cadets competing for an EA must successfully meet appropriate physical fitness requirements IAW AFI 36-2905, Fitness Program, and AFI 36-2905, AFROTC Supplement, and paragraph 4.42. Additionally, scholarship cadets must meet BMI and body fat standards. Refer to Table 4.2 for contract cadets who fail to meet prescribed standards. A cadet who receives a CE during the semester for failure to meet weight/body fat standards is required to meet the standards within 30 days into the next term or be det dropped or investigated for disenrollment.

----

#### 4.41.{#4_41} Other Retention Standards.

##### 4.41.1.{#4_41_1} This section includes other standards that make a cadet ineligible for a commission. Examples include: claim to be a conscientious objector; refusal to accept assignment or duties involving the use of nuclear weapons or combat; inability to successfully complete a National Agency Check, etc.

##### 4.41.2.{#4_41_2} AFROTC members are prohibited from actively participating (active participation includes publicly demonstrating or rallying, fund raising, recruiting and training members, organizing, or leading) in the following types of organizations:

+ 4.41.2.1. Those supporting supremacist causes or advocating illegal discrimination, based on race, creed, color, sex, religion, national origin, or ethnic group.

+ 4.41.2.2. Those advocating the use of force or violence, or otherwise engaging in efforts to deprive individuals of their civil rights.

+ 4.41.2.3. Mere membership in these types of organizations, while discouraged, is not prohibited.

----

#### 4.42.{#4_42} BMI and Body Fat Standards.

##### 4.42.1.{#4_42_1} BMI and body fat determinations remain part of accession physical standards and are used as entry criteria for AFROTC consistent with DoDI 1308.3, DoD Physical Fitness and Body Fat Programs Procedures, and AFRSI 36-2001, Recruiting Procedures for the Air Force. Conduct BMI checks on all cadets within 15 days prior to enlistment or scholarship activation. If over BMI, conduct body fat measurement in accordance with DoDI 1308.3. The maximum body fat standard is 20% for males and 28% for females.

##### 4.42.2.{#4_42_2} Non-contract GMC cadets must meet BMI or body fat standards prior to enlistment, scholarship activation, and/or FT attendance.

##### 4.42.3.{#4_42_3} Do not send cadets to FT if they are over their BMI and body fat at the end of the spring term prior to FT. Contact AFROTC/DO to remove their FT assignment and AFROTC/RRFA to remove their EA. No waivers will be granted.

##### 4.42.4.{#4_42_4} Contract cadets are responsible for maintaining BMI and/or body fat standards. Cadets must meet Air Force BMI or body fat standards in order to activate and/or retain an AFROTC scholarship, meet the PSP selection board, to attend and complete FT, and to remain in good standing as a member of the POC through commissioning.
