# AFROTC FORM 48 PREPARATION

The AFROTC Form 48 is prepared by the cadet and reflects a tentative schedule of all courses (including summer sessions) from program entry until commissioning. Prepare the AFROTC Form 48 in pen or pencil; signatures must be in blue or black ink. If the course titles of electives are not known, list "Elective" and enter the number of proposed credit hours. Add actual course titles when they become known. Use the following instructions if completing the AFROTC Form 48:

##### Instructions for Completing AFROTC Form 48. 

----

##### Section I – Administrative Data.

Block 1 (Name). Self-explanatory.

Block 2 (Academic Institution). Enter the institution from which the applicant or cadet will receive their degree and the AFROTC detachment they are attending. If they are both the same, only one entry is required.

Block 3 (Academic Major). Enter one major field of study.

Cadets pursuing an initial baccalaureate degree must satisfy the commissioning requirement of completing an established baccalaureate academic program. These cadets must indicate a major and schedule courses that will satisfy program requirements in a realistic manner, while maintaining two full years in the POC. Since the cadet does not have a baccalaureate degree now, this major must be reflected on the AF Form 1056.

Cadets who have completed a baccalaureate degree must be working towards (taking at least one "core" course from their selected major every term) a desired degree program, pursuing a second bachelor’s degree program or a graduate degree program. These cadets must indicate the current pursuing major and schedule courses in a manner that will satisfy any full-time student requirement in the most realistic but expeditious time, while maintaining two years in the POC. Annotate the AF Form 1056 with the "pursuing" major ONLY if the cadet will complete necessary requirements to obtain a degree in the pursuing major. If by the time AFROTC training is completed the cadet will NOT successfully complete the necessary requirements associated with the pursuing major, annotate the AF Form 1056 with the baccalaureate degree previously granted.

Minors and double majors cannot be reflected on the academic plan if doing so will hinder satisfying program objectives (receiving a baccalaureate degree). Cadets are authorized to pursue a double major or obtain a minor only upon the detachment’s receipt of an academic plan signed by an academic advisor establishing a valid date of commission for one major. Once this is complete, the cadet may add additional hours to already existing certified academic plan to meet the requirements of a minor or a second major. Adding additional hours must not place the cadet at risk of taking too many hours per term, require additional terms, or change the already established commissioning date. If the cadet’s academic plan satisfies this requirement, annotate the AFROTC Form 1056 with only the major in which the cadet wishes to be accessed in the Air Force.

Block 4 (Institutional Official Review). Accomplished by the institution academic advisor. If the advisor refuses to review the plan, a detachment officer must determine whether the individual can meet degree and commissioning requirements using the institutional catalog to ensure the courses listed for the applicable academic major are reflected on the AFROTC Form 48. If the detachment officer concurs with the planned academic program, he/she must sign and date the AFROTC Form 48 in the space marked "Institutional Official's Signature/Date." Attach a memorandum stating the reason an academic advisor did not review the academic plan.

Block 5 (Initial Review). Enter the specific degree (BA, BS, etc.) and the month and year (include fiscal year) the contracted degree is scheduled for completion. Ensure the determined date of graduation (DOG) and DOC are realistic; many technical majors take 4.5 to 5 years to complete. A cadet in an academic program that is traditionally 4.5 or 5 years in length should have a DOG and DOC reflecting that reality. Schedule such cadets for extended status. The cadet will then sign the appropriate block. A detachment officer will review all information on the form, sign and date block 5.

Block 6. Cadet must sign and date after all degree requirements have been successfully completed and graduation will occur as stated in Block 5.

##### Section II – Academic Plan. Annotate all courses planned for each term. Include summer terms, PNA, extended status, co-op, field training, and terms abroad. NOTE: If using the AFROTC Form 48, the shaded areas are for detachment personnel use only and will be accomplished during term reviews.

Term. Enter the term designation such as fall, winter, spring, summer, and year for each academic term scheduled; e.g., spring '05.

Course Number. Enter the appropriate information as listed in the school catalog.

Course Title. Provide short, abbreviated course titles when possible. For example: "History and Principles of the Interpretation of the Bible" could be "Bible;" "General Psychology" could be "Gen Psy;" or "Inorganic Medical Chemistry" could be "Inorg Med Chem".

Credit Hours Attempted. Enter the number of credit hours for the specific term as specified for the course in the college catalog, regardless of whether the credit hours directly apply to the major. Once the credit hours for each course are annotated, add all hours under the column "Credit Hours Attempted" and place the sum value in the "Total Credit Hours Attempted" block.
