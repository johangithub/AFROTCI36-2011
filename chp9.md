#### 9.1.{#9_1} General. 

This chapter explains the categorization procedures for rated AFSCs and provides information pertaining to non-line AFSCs and other specialized officer career fields. The OPR for this chapter is HQ AFROTC/RRF.

----

#### 9.2.{#9_2} Rated Categorization Board

##### 9.2.1.{#9_2_1} Purpose. To categorize cadets into Pilot, Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), Combat Systems Operator (CSO), or Air Battle Manager (ABM) career fields.

##### 9.2.2.{#9_2_2} AFROTC senior officers place cadets in categories to meet Air Force officer production objectives. For officer candidates competing for a Pilot/RPA/CSO/ABM slot, categorization occurs in the FY prior to commissioning (AS300 year for 4-year program cadets and AS400 year for 5-year program cadets).

##### 9.2.3.{#9_2_3} Eligibility Requirements.

+ 9.2.3.1. Cadets volunteering for rated duty should understand they may be assigned to any rated categorization, i.e. pilot, CSO, RPA or ABM, for which they are qualified.

+ 9.2.3.2. Cadets competing in the rated categorization process must have a CGPA of at least 2.5 on a 4.0 scale. TGPA is not a factor for eligibility. The ROTC CGPA must reflect all courses taken to include repeat courses, transfer credits, and those forgiven by the university.

+ 9.2.3.3. Cadets already selected for a non-line enrollment allocation (nurse, medical, dental) are ineligible to compete for any rated category.

+ 9.2.3.4. The selection rate for certain critical majors can be constrained in order to satisfy those Air Force accessions requirements. Cadets in critical majors are eligible to compete, but the selection rate may be less than the board average selection rate.

+ 9.2.3.5. Cadets must be medically screened in WINGS. Pilot candidates must be PPQ, RPA candidates must be PRPQ, and CSO candidates must be PCQ, and ABM candidates must be PAQ in WINGS in order to compete.

##### 9.2.4.{#9_2_4} Approximate Schedule of Events.

+ 9.2.4.1. Before nomination, take medical information from the latest certified physical exam and enter it into the corresponding portions of the Pilot/Nav/RPA Screening Exam tab in WINGS. WINGS will use this information to determine whether the cadet is potentially medically qualified for pilot, RPA, CSO, or ABM.

+ 9.2.4.2. NLT first week of January: Complete testing of Test of Basic Aviation Skills (TBAS), so Pilot Candidate Selection Model (PCSM) can be updated and entered into WINGS. PCSM score is required to compete for pilot and RPA pilot.

	+ 9.2.4.2.1. The TBAS can be taken up to two times, separated by at least 180 days.

+ 9.2.4.3. Middle of January: Update accrued flying hours in order to ensure the PCSM score is accurate/current. PCSM score is required to compete for pilot and RPA pilot.

+ 9.2.4.4. First week of February: Categorization board held.

+ 9.2.4.5. Third week of February: Categorization board results announced via ARMS message and results updated in WINGS.

+ 9.2.4.6. Last week in August: Deadline for all FT result inputs for the categorization continuation process. This is done by AFROTC/DOT.

+ 9.2.4.7. Last week of September: Categorization continuation process, Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) selection process, and Supplemental Board completed.

+ 9.2.4.8. First week in October: Categorization continuation process, ENJJPT, and Supplemental Board results released.

##### 9.2.5.{#9_2_5} Non-Rated Line Cadets. AFROTC/RRFP will only categorize cadets with EA into pilot, RPA, CSO, and ABM categories. Senior year cadets who are not qualified for or do not desire these categories will retain "Officer" in CAT- SEL field on the SMR and be assigned an Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) by the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) via the AFROTC Form 53, Cadet Information.

##### 9.2.6.{#9_2_6} The pilot categorization board will convene prior to the RPA board, the RPA board prior to the CSO board, and the CSO board will convene prior to the ABM board. Cadets selected for one board will not meet the subsequent board(s).

##### 9.2.7.{#9_2_7} Rated Categorization Requirements.

+ 9.2.7.1. All eligible cadets may compete for a rated category slot. Cadet physicals for pilot/RPA/CSO/ABM must meet the most restrictive AFMSA standard in the pilot/RPA/CSO/ABM screen exam in WINGS for their desired category prior to submission. Meeting the medical pre-screening eligibility criteria prior to the board does not guarantee the cadet will be qualified on the appropriate flight physical; this process only establishes "potential" qualification. If a cadet does not meet AFMSA standards for the requested category in time to meet the submission deadline, consider the cadet unqualified for the category and do not nominate. If the cadet later meets AFMSA standards and wants to request pilot/RPA/CSO/ABM categorization, submit an AFROTC Form 22 package to AFROTC/RRFA.

+ 9.2.7.2. Cadets who undergo Corneal Refractive Surgery (CRS) will need to supplement their current physical with a new eye examination provided by their ophthalmologist. The eye examination cannot be given earlier than 3 months after the operation and results must be evaluated/certified by HQ AETC/SG prior to submission. Update the physical (including the supplemental eye examination) information in the pilot/RPA/CSO screen exam in WINGS to determine if the cadet is qualified for their desired category. Counsel each cadet who meets the rated categorization board that they will be required to pass a IFCI/MFS physical at WPAFB (if selected as a pilot), a FCIIU physical (if selected as an RPA) (also conducted at WPAFB), a FCIA physical (if selected as a CSO), or a FCIII physical (if selected as an ABM) after rated selection, but prior to commissioning.

+ 9.2.7.3. Candidates must meet the AFOQT minimum scores shown in Table 9.1. These scores are not waiverable for rated duty, even if previously waived for enlistment.

##### Table 9.1.{#table9_1} Minimum AFOQT Scores (non-waiverable for rated duty).
||Pilot|CSO (Nav)| ABM|Verbal|Quantitative|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Pilot | 25| | |15|10|
|RPA |25| | | 15|10|
|CSO | |25| | 15|10|
|ABM | | |25|15|10|

+ 9.2.7.4. Pilot and RPA candidates must complete the TBAS so a Pilot Candidate Selection Model (PCSM) score can be computed prior to categorization. TBAS testing requirements are outlined in AFI36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System. Only two test administrations are authorized per individual. Do not administer a retest (second testing) until at least 180 days have passed from the date of initial testing. The detachment TBAS monitor must inform cadets who only one TBAS retest is authorized. The PCSM office will automatically invalidate third and subsequent TBAS attempts. Similar to the administration of the AFOQT, TBAS data from the most recent test will be used as the score of record for those individuals with more than one set of scores. This is not waiverable.

	+ 9.2.7.4.1. The TBAS must be taken by the HQ AFROTC-established cut-off date to ensure a valid PCSM score is available. Ensure cadets take the TBAS early enough to allow for a second test prior to 1 Jan of the categorization year. PCSM scores may be obtained from the HQ AETC/SAS homepage: https://pcsm.aetc.af.mil.

+ 9.2.7.5. Flying hours must be accrued before 1 January and forwarded to HQ AETC/SAS prior to the established cut-off date. Procedures for updating PCSM scores are located on the PCSM homepage. Flying hours obtained after 1 January will not be used to update the PCSM score for the February board.

+ 9.2.7.6. Cadets competing for rated categorization must commission before age 29 to allow AFPC time to schedule training prior to age 30. This is not waiverable.

##### 9.2.8.{#9_2_8} Rated Categorization Processing.

+ 9.2.8.1. The Detachment/CC will assign each individual a DCR based on the entire FY commissioning class. As with PSP selection, consider the cadet's potential based on performance as a cadet before assigning the DCR. WINGS will compute the RSS based upon the DCR and class size.

##### Table 9.2.{#table9_2} Rated Order of Merit.
|FACTOR|WEIGHT|
|---|---|
|AFOQT-Nav (Note 2)| 40% |
|PCSM (Note 2)| 40% |
|AFOQT-ABM| 40% |
|RSS (Note 1) |TBD |
|PFA |TBD |
|FT |TBD |
|Cumulative GPA | TBD|

Notes:

1. The formula for calculating RSS and FT is (10*((1-R/C)+0.5/C)) where R=DCR and C=Class Size

2. The PCSM is used for categorization processing if applying for pilot and RPA. The AFOQT- Nav is used for categorization processing if applying for CSO. The AFOQT-ABM is used for categorization processing if applying for ABM.

3. AFROTC/CC will determine the weights and the OM factors.



+ 9.2.8.2. Nominate rated candidates to AFROTC/RRFP by entering categorization data into WINGS prior to nomination cut-off. WINGS will compute each candidate's OM score using the most current information available. Once the OM is calculated and the applicant has met the categorization process, the OM will not be adjusted.

+ 9.2.8.3. Exception: Cadets not completing FT prior to the board will automatically receive FT score of "0." Once FT is complete, upward adjustment to the OM is recalculated based on FT results only and happens automatically.

##### 9.2.9.{#9_2_9} Cadets: Must submit preferences via memorandum to the commander prior to the established cut-off date: Cadets are volunteering for any rated duty position for which they are qualified. A cadet that volunteers for Pilot also volunteers for RPA/CSO/ABM. A cadet that volunteers for RPA also volunteers for CSO and ABM. A cadet that volunteers for CSO also volunteers for ABM.

+ 9.2.9.1. Cadets competing for pilot must indicate their Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) preference (Attachment 25). Preferences must be updated in WINGS prior to nomination cut-off. NOTE: Cadets volunteering for ENJJPT must understand that ENJJPT is a fighter-oriented program and if eliminated from ENJJPT, they will not be eligible for any other UPT.

+ 9.2.9.2. Submit security clearances upgrade to OPM within 30 days of the cadet's notification once selected.

+ 9.2.9.3. Notify AFROTC/RR (preferred method of notification via email) when the cadet:

	+ 9.2.9.3.1. Does not complete the change page to the contract. Withdraw the rated EA.

	+ 9.2.9.3.2. No longer desires the requested category.

	+ 9.2.9.3.3. Cadets who decline a rated slot (pilot, RPA, CSO, or ABM) after selection will be ineligible to re-apply for UFT per AFI 36-2205, Applying for Flying Training, Air Battle Manager, and Astronaut Programs.

	+ 9.2.9.3.4. Medically disqualified for rated duty.

		+ 9.2.9.3.4.1. AFROTC/RR will initiate action to revoke rated EA upon receipt of medical disqualification from AETC/SG in order to facilitate efficient/ effective rated allocation management and to ensure that rated allocations do not go unfilled. It is detachment responsibility to coordinate with AFPC/DPSIP for reclassification/assignment in new AFSC. Notify AFROTC/RRFA via WINGS trouble ticket if a cadet is later deemed medically qualified for rated duty and cadet will be added to the alternate list commensurate with order of merit.

	+ 9.2.9.3.5. Disenrollment.

##### 9.2.10.{#9_2_10} Rated Categorization Board and Detachment Notification. Detachments will be notified of selection for a rated category through WINGS. When HQ AFROTC/RRFP awards a rated allocation, the CAT-SEL field will change from "Officer" to the new category ("Pilot," "RPA," "CSO," or "ABM").

+ 9.2.10.1. The SMR is updated nightly and may not reflect categorization decisions until the next day.

##### 9.2.11.{#9_2_11} Upon receipt of the new production category from AFROTC/RRFP, complete a change page to the AF Form 1056, Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) Contract, IAW this instruction to reflect the new category within 10 workdays/school days of cadet's notification. If the cadet does not complete the change page to the contract, contact AFROTC/RRFP to pull the allocation.

+ 9.2.11.1. In addition, submit SSBI security clearance documentation to OPM within
30 days of cadet's completion of the contract change page.

##### 9.2.12.{#9_2_12} Counseling Requirements. Counsel, , all rated categorized cadets, via AFROTC Form 16, that they will lose this category if they require a change of DOC to a new FY or are medically disqualified by HQ AETC/SG.

+ 9.2.12.1. Cadets who do not receive a certified FCI/FCIIU/FCIA/FCIII physical within one year after selection or 30 days prior to commissioning, whichever is earlier, will lose their rated category.

+ 9.2.12.2. Cadets who receive probation as a result of a disenrollment investigation may lose their rated categorization as a stipulation of probation. See paragraph 4.39.

##### 9.2.13.{#9_2_13} Out-of-Cycle Categorization. Cadets who desire to categorize into pilot, RPA, CSO, or ABM after the board cut-off must meet appropriate AFMSA standards for the desired category. Submit an AFROTC Form 22 package to AFROTC/RRFA with appropriate track preferences (Attachment 25). NOTE: Cadets who require a change of DOC into a new FY will lose their pilot/RPA/CSO/ABM categorization and are subject to reclassification based on the needs of the Air Force. Cadets who previously competed for pilot/RPA/CSO/ABM allocations and were not selected are not eligible for recategorization to pilot/RPA/ CSO/ABM in subsequent years. HQ AFROTC/RR will approve these changes only if shortages in rated positions exist.

+ 9.2.13.1. Detachments will submit an AFROTC Form 22 package requesting categorization into pilot/RPA/CSO/ABM. The package MUST include the requested category or categories, DCR, PCSM score (if requesting pilot or RPA categorization), and ENJJPT preferences.

##### 9.2.14.{#9_2_14} Continuation Board. The purpose of the Continuation Board is to recomplete cadets boarded in February without an FT ranking. Because the OM includes FT performance and some cadets have not yet attended FT, a portion of the rated allocations will not be allocated pending post-FT evaluation.

+ 9.2.14.1. Only cadets who met the February board (but were not selected) will compete during the Continuation Board.

##### 9.2.15.{#9_2_15} Supplemental Board. After the Continuation Board, all the cadets nominated for rated duty after the February board will be added to the board commensurate with the OM (order of merit) calculated from their qualifying scores. Then, everyone nominated for rated duty, but not yet selected, will remain on the alternate list.

+ 9.2.15.1. Alternate List. The alternate list will be maintained for each category to backfill slots vacated by previously selected cadets.

	+ 9.2.15.1.1. The OM will not be changed from the original "snapshot" from the Rated Board or post-Rated Board nomination except for FT rankings and new PCSM generated after a second test. Once the OM has been updated, that OM will determine their placement on the alternate lists.

	+ 9.2.15.1.2. As rated slots become available, the top alternate on the applicable alternate list will be offered the slot. The top alternate is defined as the cadet with the highest OM on that alternate list.

	+ 9.2.15.1.3. If the top alternate refuses the slot, the cadet will be removed from the alternate lists. The new top alternate is then offered the available slot. This process continues until a cadet accepts the available slot or until the alternate list is exhausted.

	+ 9.2.15.1.4. If the top alternate being offered a slot from the alternate list already has a rated slot, the cadet will have the option of remaining in the current category or accepting the new slot. For example, if a cadet has a CSO slot and is subsequently offered a pilot slot, the cadet may decline the pilot slot and retain the CSO slot or accept the pilot slot, generating a new CSO vacancy.

+ 9.2.15.2. AFROTC rated slots can only be offered to cadets prior to commissioning and not to newly commissioned lieutenants. Thus, when an AFROTC cadet on the alternate list is commissioned, they are removed from alternate list consideration.

+ 9.2.15.3. An alternate list will be maintained for each of the rated categories until the end of the FY.

#### 9.3.{#9_3} Non-Line (Pre-Health and Dental) Selection Process.

##### 9.3.1.{#9_3_1} Cadets selected for a non-line enrollment allocation are ineligible to compete for any rated category and are ineligible to apply for an educational delay.

##### 9.3.2.{#9_3_2} Pre-Health and Dental Selection Boards. Pre-health and dental selection occurs after the rated selection board and one year prior to commissioning (AS300 year for 4- year program cadets and AS400 year for 5-year program cadets). All pre-health and dental non- line candidates should submit a memorandum to the Detachment/CC requesting nomination for a non-line EA (Attachment 22). Upon receipt of the memorandum, the detachment will verify the applicant's eligibility for the requested category, update WINGS and file the memorandum in the cadet's UPRG.

+ 9.3.2.1. The following guideline explains the post-selection actions for cadets awarded a pre-health or Dental EA.

	+ 9.3.2.1.1. Cadets should schedule and complete the Medical Category Aptitude Test (MCAT) or Dental Admission Test (DAT) during spring of junior year.

	+ 9.3.2.1.2. Gain acceptance into an accredited medical school, USUHS, or dental school.

	+ 9.3.2.1.3. Provide the letter to the detachment. Detachment will forward the acceptance letter to HQ AFPC/DPAM.

	+ 9.3.2.1.4. HQ AFPC/DPAM mails contract/pay package to detachment.

	+ 9.3.2.1.5. Cadet completes documents, returns it to detachment, and detachment forwards completed contract/pay package and copy of commissioning physical to HQ AFPC/DPAM.

	+ 9.3.2.1.6. Detachment commissions cadet as a line officer in the Air Force upon graduation and reappoints cadet into the MSC upon notification from HQ AFPC/DPAM.

+ 9.3.2.2. Cadets who are unable to meet their respective non-line categorization board may request consideration via AFROTC Form 22. The decision to allow categorization/recategorization will be based on the needs of the Air Force. Cadets who want to compete for a non-line category after the board cut-off must meet all eligibility requirements for the desired category. Submit an AFROTC Form 22 package to HQ AFROTC/RRFP. Include the cadet's preference and DCR. NOTE: Cadets who require a change of DOC to a new FY will lose their non-line category and are subject to reclassification based on the needs of the Air Force.

+ 9.3.2.3. Cadets not selected may apply to participate in Air Force Health Professional Scholarship Program (AFHPSP) or Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences (USUHS) if accepted to an accredited medical or dental school prior to commissioning. If the cadet has a Tech EA with critical major, detachments must contact AFROTC/RR via email for permission to apply and include a scanned copy of the letter of acceptance. If approved, the cadet will be authorized to pursue application for AFHPSP. Selection boards for AFHPSP are generally held monthly from October to April. AFROTC cadets on educational delay to attend medical school may apply for a three-year AFHPSP scholarship.

##### 9.3.3.{#9_3_3} Pre-Health Professions Program (Pre-HPP) Description.

+ 9.3.3.1. AFROTC currently awards the pre-health EA and provides the selectee names to AFPC/DPAMN which, in turn, manages the AFHPSP and the USUHS allocation. (Reference AFI 41-110, Medical Health Care Professions Scholarship Programs.)

+ 9.3.3.2. Pre-HPP Designation. The Pre-HPP interfaces with the AFHPSP and Financial Assistance Program (AFHPS/FAP). Pre-HPP cadets (Category Selection "Premedical" or "Dental" in WINGS) are guaranteed an AFHPS/FAP graduate medical school scholarship provided they obtain acceptance to an accredited medical school in the United States or Puerto Rico before April 15th of their senior year. Cadets who obtain acceptance to an accredited medical or dental school after April 15th but prior to their commissioning date, will be considered for medical or dental school scholarship award on a case-by-case basis through AFPC/DPAME and DPAMD respectively. Cadets are not guaranteed selection for admission to USUHS. Pre-HPP (pre-medical) cadets can apply simultaneously to USUHS and other medical schools for completion of their studies; however they will be required to make a decision on accepting the USUHS or the HPSP scholarship NLT the beginning of April in the year of their AFROTC graduation date. USUHS will notify HQ AFPC/DPAME of AFROTC cadets selected to attend USUHS. AFPC/DPAME will send the detachment a contract package to be completed by the cadet. The detachment will ensure the contract package is returned to DPAME by the established suspense date. Detachments will commission these individuals into the line of the Air Force upon completion of their undergraduate degree and reappoint them into the Medical Service Corps the next day. HQ AFPC/DPAMF2 will initiate appointment orders to include orders to enter active duty for medical school training.

	+ 9.3.3.2.1. Acceptance or declination of a pre-health identifier is required within
7 days of notification. Counsel each cadet receiving a pre-health identifier via AFROTC Form 16 and document their acceptance or declination within the 7 days and file in the cadet UPRG.

	+ 9.3.3.2.2. If the cadet declines the Pre-health designator then the cadet will be awarded an EA allocation consistent with their degree (tech or non-tech).

+ 9.3.3.3. Non-Pre-HPP. Cadets who are not designated Pre-HPP, but who desire an Air Force career as a physician, dentist, or a select Biomedical Sciences Corps (BSC) officer specialty identified in the annual program announcement may apply for these programs. Upon receipt of acceptance to an accredited medical, dental, or applicable allied health graduate or post-graduate school, the cadet, through their Det, must send a copy of the memorandum of acceptance to HQ AFPC/DPAME (medical), DPAMD (dental), or DPAMW (biomedical sciences) to apply for an AFHPSP scholarship. Prospective BSC officer candidates may also apply for an educational delay (at individual expense) for appropriate graduate-level health profession studies. During their final year of the advanced education program, the candidate may then apply to AFPC/DPAMW for the selection to the qualifying AFSC. If selected, he/she will be reappointed into the Air Force Biomedical Sciences Corps (BSC) upon program completion.

+ 9.3.3.4. Pre-Health and Dental Non-line Categorization. Pre-Health and Dental Non-line Categorization Requirements:

	+ 9.3.3.4.1. Cadets must be awarded an EA during PSP to be considered for a Pre- Health or Dental EA.

	+ 9.3.3.4.2. CGPA and academic major pre-requisites will be specified by AFPC functionals and announced via ARMS message for the board.

	+ 9.3.3.4.3. Age Requirements. Pre-HPP cadets must commission before their 35th birthday to be eligible to compete for the AFHPS/FAP program.

	+ 9.3.3.4.4. Enlistment Requirements. Procedures for enlisting pre-health and nursing candidates in the ORS are the same as those required by other individuals entering AFROTC.

	+ 9.3.3.4.5. Commissioning Requirements. Special commissioning requirements are outlined in Chapter 12 of this instruction.

##### 9.3.4.{#9_3_4} Detachment Non-line (Pre-health) Categorization Processing.

+ 9.3.4.1. The Detachment/CC or representative should brief cadets on the non-line categorization process in preparation for categorization process.

+ 9.3.4.2. The Detachment/CC will assign each individual a DCR based on the entire FY class, regardless of when the individual is competing for a non-line category. WINGS will compute the RSS based on the DCR and class size.

+ 9.3.4.3. Nominate pre-health candidates as stated in the ARMS message.

##### 9.3.5.{#9_3_5} Non-Line Categorization Board and Detachment Notification.

+ 9.3.5.1. Cadets who are unqualified for, or do not desire, a non-line category will retain "Officer" in "category selection" and remain "line" officers.

+ 9.3.5.2. Enrollment Allocations. WINGS will reflect the selection results. When AFROTC/RRFP awards a nursing EA the CAT-SEL block in WINGS will reflect "Nurse". If selected for Pre-health or Dental, the CAT-SEL block of the SMR will change from officer candidate "Officer" to the new category ("Pre-Health" or "Dental" in WINGS. Upon receipt of the new production category from HQ AFROTC/RRFP, complete a change page to the AF Form 1056 within 10 workdays/school days of cadet's notification. If the cadet does not complete the change page to the contract, contact HQ AFROTC/RRFP to pull the allocation.)

+ 9.3.5.3. The non-line OM is determined by the agency running the selection process/board.

#### 9.4.{#9_4} Biomedical Sciences Corps (BSC) and Medical Service Corps (MSC).

##### 9.4.1.{#9_4_1} The BSC is a non-line, medically oriented corps that usually has a minimum mandatory education requirement of a master's degree in a specific field such as clinical social work, speech therapy, industrial hygiene, health physics, medical physics, public health, entomology, microbiology, physician assistant studies, etc. In addition, some require doctoral degrees for entry, such as clinical psychology, physical therapy, optometry, podiatry, audiology, veterinary medicine, and pharmacy. The following BSC career fields require a bachelor's degree; medical technology, architecture, bioenvironmental engineering, dietetics, occupational therapy, and aerospace physiology. Exceptions to the education requirements are made on a case-by-case basis by the respective BSC Associate Corps Chief and HQ AFPC/DPAMW. Since the number required in each field is quite small and most members are granted direct commissions as Air Force officers, the allocations are largely given to the Recruiting Service to fill and not to AFROTC. (Reference the Biomedical Science Corps Webpage on the following AFPC website: https://gum- crm.csd.disa.mil/app/answers/detail/a_id/13765/kw/42 x/p/8%2C9/r_id/100169).

+ 9.4.1.1. At the beginning of each fiscal year, HQ AFPC/DPAMW publishes a program announcement identifying those allied health specialties for which HPSP scholarships will be available. HQ AFROTC will ensure that this announcement is sent to all detachments. Detachment/CCs will identify to HQ AFROTC those graduating cadets eligible and interested in applying. If released to compete, cadets should apply for available programs seeking acceptance to the applicable program. Cadets who receive an acceptance letter from an accredited program must take a copy of the letter to their detachment as soon as possible. The detachment will forward a copy of that acceptance letter to HQ AFPC/DPAMW. The cadets may then meet a selection board and if selected for a BSC HPSP scholarship, they will be contacted by HQ AFPC/DPAMW. HQ AFPC/DPAMW will work closely with cadets to complete required contracts and other documents. HQ AFPC/DPAMW will send the detachment a contract package to be completed by the cadet. The detachment will make sure the contract package is completed and returned to HQ AFPC/DPAMW by the suspense date. Detachments will commission these individuals as line officers in the Air Force upon completion of their undergraduate degree and reappoint them into the MSC the following day. HQ AFPC/DPAMW will cut Appointment orders for the MSC as well as EAD orders on these individuals. The following guideline outlines the general application and acceptance requirements for the cadet and cadre.

	+ 9.4.1.1.1. At the beginning of the senior year, check HQ AFPC/DPAMW program announcement for available BSC HPSP scholarship specialties.

	+ 9.4.1.1.2. Obtain release from AFROTC/RR (and HQ AFPC/DPSIP if necessary) to apply for BSC HPSP.

	+ 9.4.1.1.3. Complete GRE as required by the program for which the cadet will be applying.

	+ 9.4.1.1.4. Gain acceptance into accredited institution with the appropriate degree program.

	+ 9.4.1.1.5. Take acceptance letter to detachment.

	+ 9.4.1.1.6. Detachment forwards letter to HQ AFPC/DPAMW.

+ 9.1.1.7. If cadet is selected, HQ AFPC/DPAMW mails contract package to detachment.

	+ 9.4.1.1.8. Cadet completes paperwork and returns it to detachment, detachment sends completed contract/pay package and copy of commissioning physical to HQ AFPC/DPAMW.

	+ 9.4.1.1.9. Detachment commissions cadet as a line officer in the Air Force upon graduation and reappoints cadet into the BSC upon approval from AFPC.

##### 9.4.2.{#9_4_2} The MSC is a non-line officer career field in healthcare administration. Undergraduate qualifying degrees to apply for the MSC have historically included health care administration, hospital administration, health services administration, health administration, public administration, business administration, business management, health management and policy, information systems management, computer science, finance, accounting, statistics, marketing, economics, clinical or health systems engineering, or other closely- related degree as specified in the MSC Applicant Information Guide published annually by HQ AFPC/DPAMS. Cadets - interested in applying should contact HQ AFPC/DPAMS at DSN 665-4094 or Comm (210) 565-4094 NLT the spring semester of the AS300 (junior) year for application instructions.

##### 9.5.2.{#9_5_2} Career Field Description.

STOs are career special operators that lead Special Tactics (ST) forces in the full spectrum of military operations. Special Tactics Squadrons (STS) consist of combat controllers (CCT), pararescuemen (PJ), special operations weathermen (SOWT), and tactical air control specialists (TACP). ST personnel are designated as combat forces assigned to Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). ST core competencies include assault zone assessment, establishment, and control; combat search and rescue/personnel recovery; battlefield trauma care; terminal attack control (controlling and sequencing air strikes); and tactical weather observations and forecasting. ST forces execute a wide variety of missions such as: Direct Action, Counter-Terrorism, Foreign Internal Defense, Unconventional Warfare, Humanitarian Assistance, Coalition Support, Counter-Drug, Combat Search and Rescue, and Special Reconnaissance missions. STOs routinely operate alongside their joint special operations teammates, including members of the Army's Special Forces Groups and Ranger Regiment, the Marine Special Operations Battalions, and the Navy SEAL Teams. Operating in all climates, day or night, ST forces maintain the highest standards of physical fitness, proficiency in the use of mission specific equipment, light and heavy weapons, and demolitions.

##### 9.5.3.{#9_5_3} Training.

All candidates are required to complete the STO training pipeline. This includes the Combat Control Selection Course (4 weeks); Combat Control Operator Course (15 weeks); Army Airborne School (3 weeks); Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) School (3 weeks); Combat Control Apprentice Course (13 weeks); SCUBA School (4 weeks); Military Freefall School (4 weeks); and an additional year of advanced skills training. Many STOs will also become qualified as Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC) Instructors and Evaluators, and Static-Line and Freefall Jumpmasters.

##### 9.5.4.{#9_5_4} Application Procedures.

Cadets should apply during their junior year (for a 4-year program cadet) or senior year (for 5 year program cadets). There are two selection cycles per year (fall and spring). This allows the cadet adequate time to prepare for and complete all selection requirements. AFPC will currently allow cadets classified in another career field to apply for STO prior to commissioning. See current STO application on the AFROTC website for specific application requirements.

#### 9.10.{#9_10} AFIT-Sponsored Fellowships, Scholarships, and Grants.

##### 9.10.1.{#9_10_1} The AFIT-sponsored Fellowships, Scholarships, and Grants program allows new commissionees the opportunity to compete to further their education, earning a master's degree or PhD degree. Boards are held at AFIT which determine participants in this program. A board is conducted semi-annually. The program allows a predetermined number of newly commissioned cadets who have been offered a scholarship, fellowship, or grant to pursue their education as AFIT students and is governed by AFI 36-2302, Professional Development (Advanced Academic Degrees and Professional Continuing Education). Individuals enrolled in the program are on active duty, engaged in full-time study or research, and agree in writing to serve the ADSC specified in AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments (ADSC). This program differs from others in that funding for the individual's education must be from an AFIT-approved source, not from AFIT itself.

##### 9.10.2.{#9_10_2} Approved sources may include non-foreign tax-exempt corporations, foundations, funds, or educational institutions organized primarily for scientific, literary, or educational purposes. A simple offer of employment (e.g., as a teaching assistant) does not qualify as a fellowship, scholarship, or grant.

##### 9.10.3.{#9_10_3} Participation in this program involves a series of steps described at the AFIT/ENEL website (https://www.afit.edu/cip/) and with the current AFIT program manager responsible for the fellowship, scholarship, or grant program.

+ 9.10.3.1. Cadets should research the various fellowships, scholarships and/or grants for which they are interested in competing and determine if they fall within the guidance established by AFI 36-2302. Only offers based on academic competition will be considered by AFIT.

+ 9.10.3.2. Once it is determined where the cadet wishes to apply, the cadet must send a memorandum to AFIT/ENEL requesting permission to compete for one or several fellowships, scholarships and/or grants (Attachment 26). Send this and other correspondence to AFIT/ENEL, 2950 Hobson Way, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433- 7221. The fax number is (937) 255-5371 or DSN 785-5371.

+ 9.10.3.3. The AFIT program manager will inform the cadet if they may apply, and if not, will provide justification.

+ 9.10.3.4. Once the cadet receives AFIT approval, they may apply to the organizations offering the fellowship, scholarship, or grant. It is the cadets' responsibility to ensure they meet AFIT's suspense throughout the application process.

+ 9.10.3.5. Once the cadet receives confirmation that they are accepted to the school and they are awarded the fellowship, scholarship, or grant, the cadet must forward an application package to AFIT/ENEL. The package consists of: Application to Accept Fellowship, Scholarship, or Grant cover letter (Attachment 27); financial statement (Attachment 28); narrative outline of work to be undertaken; school acceptance letter; letter of fellowship, scholarship, or grant offer; official transcripts from all colleges attended; and appropriate letters of recommendation (addressed to the AFIT Scholarship Board).

+ 9.10.3.6. The AFIT Scholarship Board will convene and rank the packages based on many different factors to include the Air Force relevancy of the proposed research, fellowship, scholarship, or grant coverage, GPA, etc. The board results are reviewed and approved or disapproved by the Dean of Civilian Institution Programs. AFPC is the final approval authority to determine if cadets may pursue their requested degree or if AF needs dictate they serve in their AFSC.

+ 9.10.3.7. AFIT/ENEL will notify all applicants of results following the board process.
