
#### 3.1.{#3_1} Purpose.

##### 3.1.1.{#3_1_1} The AFROTC Scholarship Program is designed solely to support the overall AFROTC mission to recruit and retain students to meet United States Air Force officer production requirements. The program provides an incentive to attract and retain high quality individuals whose academic specialties, leadership potential, and personal and physical qualities meet Air Force accession objectives. The OPR for this chapter is AFROTC/RRU.

----

#### 3.2.{#3_2} General Information.

##### 3.2.1.{#3_2_1} This chapter provides guidelines for the administration of the AFROTC Scholarship Program for AFROTC Detachments. AFROTC/RRU administratively manages the application and selection policies and procedures for all AFROTC scholarship programs. AFROTC/RRF administratively manages all scholarship cadets upon enlistment and activation, regardless of source of the scholarship.

##### 3.2.2.{#3_2_2} Annually, the AFROTC/CC will approve a scholarship program that specifies the number, types and qualification requirements for Commander's Scholarship, Express, Foreign Language Express, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, In-College and High School Scholarship Program scholarships.

##### 3.2.3.{#3_2_3} All scholarship cadets will major in an academic discipline identified as either "mandatory" or "desired" to qualify for an Air Force Specialty Code as listed in the Air Force Officer Classification Directory or in an approved foreign language. The desired/mandatory list is available on the Registrar section of the Holm Center Restricted webpage.

----

#### 3.3.{#3_3} Scholarship Authorization. The AFROTC scholarship program is authorized by Title 10, United States Code, Section 2107, Financial Assistance Program for Specially Selected Members, amendments to 10 U.S.C. 2107, and annual National Defense Authorization Acts. Guidance for scholarship authorizations by academic specialty is provided by the Air Force in response to officer production needs.

----

#### 3.4.{#3_4} Scholarship Programs.

##### 3.4.1.{#3_4_1} The AFROTC scholarship program consists of three main parts: the High School Scholarship Program (HSSP), the In-College Scholarship Program (ICSP), and the Enlisted Commissioning Program (ECP).

##### 3.4.2.{#3_4_2} The High School Scholarship Program Section (AFROTC/RRUC) administers the HSSP. The HSSP provides 3- and 4-year scholarship offers to high school seniors and graduates who have no full-time college experience. Students who have participated in a joint high school/college credit program prior to high school graduation may still apply via the HSSP program. Applicants must meet all eligibility requirements.

##### 3.4.3.{#3_4_3} The In-College Scholarship Program Section (AFROTC/RRUE) administers the ICSP. The in-college programs outlined in this chapter include scholarships from 2 to 3.5 years in length targeted to college students pursuing undergraduate degrees. Students must meet all eligibility and applicable nomination requirements. Scholarship money will not be used for graduate degrees without prior approval of AFROTC/RR. Cadets should be prepared to activate their scholarship offers during the first term of the next academic year, unless noted otherwise.

##### 3.4.4.{#3_4_4} The Enlisted Commissioning Programs Section (AFROTC/RRUE) administers the ECP to include 2- to 4-year scholarships for active duty Air Force enlisted members. Eligibility and nomination procedures for enlisted programs are covered in AFI 36-2013, Officer Training School (OTS) and Enlisted Commissioning Programs (ECPS), and http://www.au.af.mil/au/Holmcenter/AFROTC/EnlistedComm/EnlistedCommissioning.asp.

----

#### 3.5.{#3_5} Types of Scholarships.

##### 3.5.1.{#3_5_1} AFROTC/RR has established the following types of scholarships to be used only at AFROTC-affiliated schools:

+ 3.5.1.1. Type 1 scholarship. Provides full tuition and fees (with no cap on tuition and authorized fees) and $600 per year for textbooks.

+ 3.5.1.2. Type 1U scholarship. An upgrade from a high school Type 2 offer in a critical technical major.

+ 3.5.1.3. Type 2 scholarship. Provides up to $18,000 per year (up to $9,000 per semester or up to $6,000 per quarter) towards tuition and fees and $600 per year for textbooks. At schools where tuition and authorized fees are over the scholarship cap, students are liable for the difference even if the tuition is below the cap when the student starts at the school, but then increases above the cap during the student's academic program.

+ 3.5.1.4. Type 3 scholarship (ICSP only). Provides up to $9,000 per year (up to $4,500 per semester or up to $3,000 per quarter) towards tuition and fees and $600 per year for textbooks. At schools where tuition and authorized fees are over the scholarship cap, students are liable for the difference even if the tuition is below the cap when the student starts at the school, but then increases above the cap during the student's academic program.

+ 3.5.1.5. Type 6 scholarship (ICSP only). Provides up to $3,000 per year (up to $1,500 per semester or up to $1,000 per quarter) towards tuition and fees and $600 per year for textbooks. At schools where tuition and authorized fees are over the scholarship cap, students are liable for the difference even if the tuition is below the cap when the student starts at the school, but then increases above the cap during the student's academic program.

+ 3.5.1.6. Type 7 scholarship (HSSP only). Provides full tuition and fees at the in-state rate and $600 per year for textbooks. The Type 7 selectee must attend a school where he/she qualifies for the in-state tuition rate.

	+ 3.5.1.6.1. Type 7 selectees are not allowed to attend a higher cost institution and pay the difference. If the annual tuition and fees increase after the scholarship has been awarded due to inflation adjustments, AFROTC will continue to pay the full in-state amount.

	+ 3.5.1.6.2. HSSP selectees who want to attend a school where annual tuition and fees exceed the in-state rate can convert a 4-year Type 7 offer to a 3-year Type 2 offer with HQ AFROTC/RRUC approval prior to enrollment in AFROTC. If a 4-year Type 7 selectee converts to a 3-year Type 2, the student must attend the same academic institution as a freshman (and complete AS100 academics and LLAB) where they intend to activate the scholarship. They must also meet scholarship activation requirements at the end of their freshman year. NOTE: Cadets cannot contract/activate 3-year Type 2 scholarships until the AS200 year and therefore are completely liable for all tuition and fee expenses the first year.

----

#### 3.6.{#3_6} Scholarship Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirements. Cadets must have a TGPA and CGPA of 2.5 or higher to be nominated for and to activate a scholarship (Exception: 4- year HSSP cadets activating scholarship the freshman year without a college GPA yet). After scholarship activation, cadets must maintain a 2.5 TGPA to remain in good academic standing. If TGPA falls below 2.5, award a conditional event (CE) (reference Table 4.2 of this instruction).

----

#### 3.7.{#3_7} Scholarship Age Limits.

##### 3.7.1.{#3_7_1} The minimum age for activation of an AFROTC scholarship is 17.

##### 3.7.2.{#3_7_2} By law, scholarship recipients must be under age 31 as of 31 December of the calendar year during which commissioning is scheduled. Title 10, USC Section 2107 does not provide for waivers.

+ 3.7.2.1. If a change in date of commissioning (DOC) places the recipient into a new calendar year (CY) that exceeds this age restriction, terminate the scholarship immediately.

----

#### 3.8.{#3_8} Tuition, Technical and Foreign Language Majors Data.

##### 3.8.1.{#3_8_1} All Tuition, Technical and Foreign Language Majors Data (including ICSP, HSSP) are used in two ways: (1) To record the annual in-state and out-of-state tuition for each host and cross-town institution, and (2) to record the approved technical and foreign language majors in which AFROTC awards scholarships at each institution. The annual in-state/out-of-state tuition costs allow AFROTC/RRUC, the detachment, and the applicant to determine if a 4- Year Type 7 selectee can attend a particular institution indicated on the selectee's Indorsement Letter (see para 3.11.3). With notification of a 4- Year Type 7 scholarship offer, AFROTC/RRUC will ask the selectee to submit the Indorsement Letter indicating whether they will accept the 4-Year Type 7 offer or convert it to a 3-Year Type 2 offer. The Technical and Foreign Language Majors Data will determine whether or not a selectee with a scholarship offer in a technical degree can attend the particular school indicated on the selectee's Indorsement Letter. Detachments will review and update annual in-state/out-of- state tuition costs (including general fees) and approved technical and foreign language degrees for each host and cross-town institution. Data for the next year needs to be provided/updated in WINGS, NLT 1 September each year so high school applicants know the costs for their first year in AFROTC. If there are any changes after 1 September, please ensure data is updated immediately in WINGS and notify RRUC.NOTE: "Approved" technical majors can be found on the www.afrotc.com website and on the Holm Center restricted website, AFROTC Registrar section. Accredited engineering majors are listed on ABET Technology Commission website while architectural majors accreditation must be verified through National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) website. Meteorology/Atmospheric Science (8FYY) majors must be reviewed at least every five (5) years by AFIT/ENEL. Non-engineering technical majors are approved if the university is accredited and the conferred degree is a Bachelor of Science, not a Bachelor of Arts. Reference paragraph 3.30 for specific degree accreditation requirements.

##### 3.8.2.{#3_8_2} All scholarship cadets (except nurses) activating scholarships in Academic Year 2012 and beyond will successfully complete either 12 semester/18 quarter hours of a single foreign language or 24 semester/36 quarter hours of math and/or physics and/or chemistry before they graduate/commission. To "successfully complete" this requirement a cadet must earn a minimum of a "C- in each respective class." The decision of whether to complete the foreign language or the Math/Physics/Chemistry requirement is the cadet's. Failure to complete this requirement prior to commissioning may result in loss of scholarship and disenrollment from the AFROTC program. NOTE: Nursing students are exempt from this requirement because their major corresponds directly to a needed AFSC.

##### 3.8.3.{#3_8_3} Prior to scholarship activation and during term counseling sessions, counsel scholarship cadets on the requirement to complete applicable Math/Physics/Chemistry or foreign language requirements prior to commissioning. Ensure each student signs the Scholarship Program Statement of Understanding (Attachment 6) at the start of the freshman year or prior to activating the scholarship. Review this requirement with the cadet each term during term counseling sessions. File the Statement in Section II of the cadet's UPRG.

+ 3.8.3.1. The Academic Plan for Math/Physics/ Chemistry or Foreign Language Requirement will be used to supplement the AFROTC Form 48 (See Attachment 7). The top portion of the page will be signed as soon as practical after the first four columns (to include "Total") are completed, but not later than the end of the first AS100 term (normally fall). All Math/Physics/Chemistry or foreign language course work will be entered prior to the cadet and cadre instructor signing the statement. During each term review, the statement will be reviewed with the cadet. Indicate which term the cadet successfully completed each required course. Once this is annotated, the cadre instructor and the cadet will initial the statement appropriately.

+ 3.8.3.2. Upon the cadet completing all required Math/Physics/Chemistry or foreign language courses, a cadre instructor will certify the plan at the bottom. The plan will be filed in Section II of the cadet's UPRG and will remain a permanent part of the cadet's UPRG. NOTE: Since the cadet is responsible for completing and signing the statement of understanding, failure to accomplish term reviews or review the statement is not a reason for a request to retain scholarship if t he cadet does not appear to be on track to complete these requirements prior to commissioning. If a cadet appears to be failing to meet this requirement, suspend the scholarship until the cadet corrects the situation.

----

#### 3.9.{#3_9} High School Scholarship Program (HSSP).

##### 3.9.1.{#3_9_1} The primary purpose of the AFROTC HSSP is to attract high quality high school seniors (or high school graduates who have not attended college as full-time students) to AFROTC. The HSSP targets primarily students interested in pursuing engineering, scientific/technical and foreign language degrees. Normally, some scholarships are also available each year to students pursuing non-technical degrees. The annual allocation of scholarships--total number, types, and academic categories--is based on fiscal considerations and Air Force officer production goals for AFROTC. The HSSP provides 4-Year Type 1, 4- Year, Type 1U, 4-Year Type 2, and 4-Year Type 7 scholarships. Students receiving 4-Year Type 7 scholarships have the option of converting to a 3-Year Type 2 scholarship.

##### 3.9.2.{#3_9_2} AFROTC/RRUC administratively manages the HSSP application and selection process and maintains primary scholarship administrative responsibility until contracting occurs. After contracting into AFROTC and scholarship activation, AFROTC/RRF manages HSSP scholarship administrative responsibility.

##### 3.9.3.{#3_9_3} HSSP Application and Information. The HSSP is announced annually through the Air Force ROTC website at www.afrotc.com. This website contains information regarding eligibility requirements, application procedures and an on-line application. Students must use the on-line application.

##### 3.9.4.{#3_9_4} HSSP Detachment Handbook. AFROTC/RRU will update and post the handbook on the Holm Center restricted website (under Registrar) no later than 1 August each year. The handbook contains information and procedures for the current HSSP cycle as well as historical data on the HSSP. The handbook specifies a structured interview process that must be followed by detachment cadre and admissions liaison officers.

##### 3.9.5.{#3_9_5} HSSP Rosters. The following rosters are located on the Admissions Liaison Officer (ALO) website (ALOweb) and Holm Center restricted website (under Registrar) for use by HQ AFROTC, detachment and recruiting personnel administering the HSSP.

+ 3.9.5.1. Detachment Interview Roster (DIR). This roster contains the names of eligible HSSP applicants who are awaiting their scholarship interview. AFROTC/RRUC assigns new eligible applicants to a detachment for administrative purposes through the DIR based on the applicant's home zip code. This roster is updated Monday-Friday from August to April and is located on the ALOweb.

+ 3.9.5.2. Board Results Rosters. There are three rosters posted to the website following each board - select, non-select, and re-board. These rosters are updated two weeks after each board. Do not send congratulatory letters to non-selects or re-boards.

+ 3.9.5.3. Letter of Admission (LOA) Roster. This roster contains HSSP selectees who have returned to AFROTC/RRUC their LOA from the AFROTC-affiliated university they plan to attend. The roster includes type, length and the academic area of the scholarship offer. This roster is updated every Thursday from March to October.

+ 3.9.5.4. Decline Roster. This roster contains HSSP selectees who have declined the AFROTC scholarship offer. This roster is updated weekly from March to October and is posted to the RR section of the Holm Center restricted website.

----

#### 3.10.{#3_10} HSSP Process and Timelines.

##### 3.10.1.{#3_10_1} To be considered for scholarship selection, all students must apply, gain eligibility and complete a scholarship interview as outlined below. The interview is the most critical aspect of the HSSP selection process. The goal for completion of the interview is 30 days after notification.

##### 3.10.2.{#3_10_2} The Application Period. The HSSP application period varies but historically runs from 1 June to 1 December each year.

##### 3.10.3.{#3_10_3} Basic Eligibility Criteria and Deadlines. Upon receipt of an application, AFROTC/RRUC will determine the applicant's status, i.e., eligible or ineligible, and notify the applicant accordingly. Applicants must submit all required application items listed on- line at www.afrotc.com by the published deadlines. To become eligible for scholarshipconsideration, applicants must:

+ 3.10.3.1. Submit the results of the ACT or SAT college entrance examination. Test scores must be attained in one testing session (i.e., test scores from different dates cannot be combined) and in a standard testing environment.

+ 3.10.3.2. Submit high school transcript(s) for grades 9 through 11.

+ 3.10.3.3. Must attain a minimum un-weighted CGPA of 3.0 (as measured at the end of the junior year in high school) and achieve either a minimum SAT total score of 1180 (verbal and math components only) or a minimum ACT composite score of 26.

+ 3.10.3.4. Complete and submit the Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA) and PFA Letter of Certification.

+ 3.10.3.5. Complete and submit the Extracurricular Activity Sheet.

+ 3.10.3.6. Submit high school counselor's certification with attached transcripts.

+ 3.10.3.7. Be 17 years of age or older at time of the scholarship activation and enlistment.

+ 3.10.3.8. Be a United States citizen or able to obtain citizenship by the last day of the first term of their freshman year for 4-year offers or the first term of their sophomore year for 3-year offers. NOTE: Cadets cannot contract/activate scholarship until becoming a US citizen.

+ 3.10.3.9. Must not have attended a post-secondary institution/academy prep school as a full-time student, except as part of high school coursework. For purposes of administering the HSSP, US Air Force Academy Preparatory Schools are considered post-secondary institutions. Students who have participated in a joint high school/college credit program prior to high school graduation may still apply via the HSSP program (these students may even apply after receiving an Associate Degree, as long as they were never a full-time student at a post-secondary institution).

+ 3.10.3.10. Since variances between detachments, universities, and high schools can generate unexpected consequences, AFROTC HSSP scholarships will continue to be 4-year offers. As such, a 4-year Type 7 HSSP recipient wishing to convert to a 3-year Type 2 offer may not activate his/her award during their first year of college despite the fact that he/she anticipates having only 3 years (or less) remaining towards a baccalaureate degree. After completing academic requirements for his/her baccalaureate degrees while completing training requirements for AFROTC, cadets may request to apply remaining scholarship entitlements towards graduate courses or they may be eligible to commission no more than one term early. Scholarship money will not be used for graduate degree courses without prior approval of AFROTC/RR. Cadets cannot take the 5th- year of entitlement (for SAF approved 5-year majors), condense their baccalaureate degree academics, and use scholarship entitlements during the fifth year for master level work. Once AFROTC classes and baccalaureate degree requirements are complete, the cadet must commission.

+ 3.10.3.11. Active duty Airmen without any full-time college may apply for HSSP if they have established a date of separation and meet the eligibility requirements for the HSSP outlined above. If they intend to separate early from the military, they must apply through the ECP (see paragraph 3.4.4).

##### 3.10.4.{#3_10_4} The Scholarship Interview. Qualified applicants are scheduled for a personal interview with a detachment near their home of record zip code, generally the nearest detachment. To change the venue requires exceptional circumstances-- AFROTC/RRU must approve any such requests prior to the interview. In cases where the venue has been changed, the applicant will be ineligible for the Commander's Scholarship (CS) for HSSP scholarship unless the change in venue was initiated by AFROTC.

+ 3.10.4.1. Detachment/CC Responsibilities. The Detachment/CC will:

	+ 3.10.4.1.1. Manage the college scholarship interview program through the Detachment Scheduling Official (DSO).

		+ 3.10.4.1.1.1. The goal for submitting the interview to RRUC is within 30 days of posting on the interview roster.

	+ 3.10.4.1.2. Schedule an officer to conduct the applicant interview. Only active duty cadre officers and Admissions Liaison Officers (ALO) may conduct interviews. Second lieutenants are not allowed to conduct HSSP interviews. Detachment/CCs are required to conduct a portion of the interviews for their detachment in order to maintain proficiency and oversight of the HSSP interview and selection processes.

	+ 3.10.4.1.3. Ensure officers tasked to complete interviews are familiar with AFI 36-2249, Evaluating USAF Academy (USAFA) Candidates and Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) College Scholarship Applicants, the interview checklist, and the guidance contained in the most recent HSSP Detachment Handbook.

	+ 3.10.4.1.4. Once the interviewing officer has completed the on-line AF Form 4060, USAFA Candidate Evaluation/AFROTC College Scholarship Evaluation on ALOweb, ensure the overall remarks are consistent with the ratings. Upon approval, the Detachment/CC electronically forwards the interview to HQ AFROTC/RRUC.

	+ 3.10.4.1.5. Ensure all cadre members understand that the interview is protected under the Privacy Act of 1974. HQ AFROTC will not release interview ratings and detachment personnel are not authorized to release interview ratings.

+ 3.10.4.2. DSO Responsibilities. The DSO will:

	+ 3.10.4.2.1. Notify AFROTC/RRUC of any changes or corrections to the name, address, phone number, or Social Security number of an applicant.

	+ 3.10.4.2.2. Schedule interview appointments by telephone or in writing (reference Attachment 2) and track them. If scheduling via telephone, recommend the applicant bring a resume or activities sheet and ensure the applicant is aware of the emphasis the selection board places on accomplishments in leadership positions. If an applicant cannot be contacted, declines, fails to show or to reschedule within 10 days, check the applicable block and put a comment on the Form 4060 in ALOweb. Also, when scheduling an interview, highly encourage a parent or guardian to attend with the applicant. This does not bear directly on the interview, but provides the family the opportunity to discuss program dynamics with the detachment staff.

+ 3.10.4.3. Interviewing Officer Responsibilities. The interviewing officer will:

	+ 3.10.4.3.1. Prior to conducting the interview, review AFI 36-2249, this instruction, the interview checklist and guidance contained in the HSSP Detachment Handbook.

	+ 3.10.4.3.2. Explain scholarship types, lengths, activation procedures and requirements, payment process and retention standards to family and the interviewee.

	+ 3.10.4.3.3. Review academic major choices and school priority with applicant and ensure any changes are reported to HQ AFROTC/RRUC. NOTE: Encourage applicants to list ONLY degrees they intend to pursue.

	+ 3.10.4.3.4. After dismissing family members, have applicant complete and sign the AFROTC Form 35 and AF Form 2030 IAW the guidance below. DO NOT complete these forms in the presence of the parents so the applicant can be honest. Advise the applicant that any further civil involvement(s), alcohol-related incidents/use or drug use may result in the loss of scholarship or ineligibility for AFROTC. Brief applicants that pre-contracting misconduct may result in loss of scholarship offers. This includes the time between submitting background information to AFROTC and enrolling/contracting as cadets. Explain that applicants who intentionally withhold information may forfeit their scholarship.

		+ 3.10.4.3.4.1. Brief applicants that AFROTC policy is to withdraw the scholarship offer for students who failed to disclose civil involvements and drug or alcohol abuse that occurred prior to the HSSP interview. These scholarships are considered obtained under fraudulent circumstances since the student failed to obtain a required waiver. AFROTC policy is also to withdraw scholarship offers for students who use drugs after being briefed on the AF drug and alcohol policy during this interview process.

		+ 3.10.4.3.4.2. AFROTC may waive subsequent drug use or alcohol abuse for program continuation but without the HSSP scholarship. Contact AFROTC/RRU for waiver guidance.

		+ 3.10.4.3.4.3. Brief applicant on DODI 1304.33, Protecting Against Inappropriate Relations During Recruiting and Entry-Level Training. Provide applicant with contact information that can be used to notify someone if they believe cadre has acted improperly. Have applicant complete DD Form 2983.

	+ 3.10.4.3.5. Detachments will use AFROTC Form 2030, Air Force ROTC Applicant Drug and Alcohol Abuse Certificate, to explain the Air Force policy on drug and alcohol abuse. Have the applicant complete the AF Form 2030. Emphasize to the applicant that any drug use (including marijuana) after the date of the interview is considered post-orientation and will render him/her ineligible for the Air Force.

		+ 3.10.4.3.5.1. If the applicant indicates previous use of marijuana, amphetamines, barbiturates, or non- prescription anabolic steroids, continue the interview. Have the applicant provide complete details by answering the questions listed on page 2 of the AF Form 2030. Ensure the applicant answers each question for each occurrence. For example, if the applicant says he used marijuana two times, then the applicant should answer the questions for each occurrence. Ensure the applicant and witness certification blocks are completed.

		+ 3.10.4.3.5.1. If the applicant has indicated use of other illegal drugs or narcotics, to include, but not limited to, cocaine, club drugs, crack, hallucinogens, and opiates, have the applicant complete the AFROTC Form 2030. Terminate the interview and inform the applicant that he/she is ineligible–waivers will not be considered. Forward the completed form to HQ AFROTC/RRUC.

	+ 3.10.4.3.6. Brief applicants on the AFROTC weight, Body Mass Index (BMI) limits and provide a current copy of the AFROTC physical fitness standards. Enter the applicant's current height and weight in the appropriate section on the AF Form 4060. Do not calculate the BMI. The interviewer must include comments on the applicant's fitness level and potential ability to meet and maintain AFROTC weight and fitness standards.

	+ 3.10.4.3.7. Electronically forward the AF Form 4060 to the Detachment/CC via ALO web. Upon the Detachment/CC's approval, upload in WINGS or scan/email the AFROTC Form 35, Certification of Involvements with Civil, Military, or School Authorities/Law Enforcement Officials (with AFROTC Forms 4 and 14 if affidavit and corroboration is required), and AF Form 2030, USAF Drug and Alcohol Abuse Certificate, to HQ AFROTC/RRUC. Instructions on how to upload documents in WINGS is located in the detachment guidebook and on the ALOweb site.

----

#### 3.11.{#3_11} HSSP Scholarship Selection Boards.

##### 3.11.1.{#3_11_1} The boards are conducted in a fashion similar to AF promotion boards and are comprised of three-member panels. The panels are typically comprised of AFROTC Detachment commanders and ALOs. AFROTC/RRUC will normally release official board results within two weeks of the conclusion of each board and notify each applicant of his/her board result. For specific board dates, refer to the HSSP Detachment Handbook.

##### 3.11.2.{#3_11_2} Scholarship Selection Letter. Each scholarship selectee will receive a congratulatory letter signed by AFROTC/RR.

##### 3.11.3.{#3_11_3} The Indorsement Letter and Checklist of Actions. Selectees will be asked to complete the Indorsement Letter and furnish a copy of their letter of admission by 31 May. The Checklist of Required Actions for Scholarship Designees provides information about the scholarship offer, tuition and other financial benefits, as well as actions the selectee must successfully complete to activate the scholarship.

----

#### 3.12.{#3_12} Additional Detachment Post-Board Actions.

##### 3.12.1.{#3_12_1} Detachments are also responsible for the following actions:

+ 3.12.1.1. Selectee Contact. The gaining detachment will make contact with every selectee as their names appear on the LOA roster.

	+ 3.12.1.1.1. The gaining detachment should use this contact as an opportunity to help the applicant with the university admission and housing process and to ascertain the status of the DoDMERB physical. If a detachment is asked by a scholarship selectee for assistance in resolving a medical disqualification, the detachment may coordinate with DoDMERB.

	+ 3.12.1.1.2. The LOA Roster should be referenced in regards to the selectee's offered academic major. If the offered academic major is a technical degree and not Air Force-approved (e.g., Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)) or not offered at the detachment's host or cross-town institutions, advise the selectee and notify HQ AFROTC/RRUC immediately. Technical degrees are listed at www.afrotc.com (Scholarships/High School Scholarships/Schools and Majors) or the Holm Center restricted website under AFROTC Registrar.

##### 3.12.2.{#3_12_2} Scholarship Authorization. In July of each year, RRUC will transfer the scholarship winners in WINGS to the detachment referenced in the LOA. The scholarships will reflect as "Awarded" in the scholarship tab. The awarded scholarship in WINGS is the scholarship authorization; there is no need to maintain a WINGS printout or a copy of the LOA roster in the cadet UPRG.

##### 3.12.3.{#3_12_3} Commander's Scholarship (CS) for HSSP. If the AFROTC/CC approves an HSSP CS, then each Detachment Commander will have one CS offer to award to HSSP applicants. The objective of the CS for HSSP is two-fold: (1) Increase the acceptance rate of HSSP selectees by making 4-Year scholarship offers as early as possible in the student's search for a college/university and funding, and (2) provide Detachment Commanders a powerful tool to recruit high quality students to their detachments to help establish and maintain a solid leadership core for the cadet wing. To ensure HSSP CS are being offered to high quality students, offers can only be made to students whose SAT or ACT scores meet or exceed the scores listed in the Detachment Guidebook. These minimum scores are based on statistics from the previous year, or as designated by AFROTC/CC. The test score standard must be met in the appropriate category for the CS offer: technical, non-technical, nurse, and foreign language.

+ 3.12.3.1. All HSSP CS scholarships are 4-year offers. The offer is a Type 1 scholarship for technical majors and a Type 2 scholarship for non-technical and foreign language majors.

+ 3.12.3.2. All potential nominees must be listed on the DIR. Upon completion of the interview, but not later than two weeks following the interview, the Detachment Commander must determine whether the applicant should be offered an HSSP CS.

+ 3.12.3.3. Detachment Commanders cannot tender an HSSP CS to an applicant who: 3.12.3.3.1. Has already met an HSSP board.

	+ 3.12.3.3.2. Whose SAT/ACT scores are not equal to or greater than the criteria in the Detachment Guidebook in the appropriate category: technical, foreign language, or non-technical; If the applicant wants to attend the host school or an official cross-town school of the interviewing detachment, the Detachment Commander can tender an HSSP CS offer. The student must verbally accept the commander's offer within two weeks of the scholarship interview but no later than 28 February each year. If more time is needed, contact AFROTC/RRUC.

+ 3.12.3.4. Once the interviewee has verbally accepted the offer, the Detachment Commander will submit the AF Form 4060 and the HSSP CS nomination letter identifying the CS nominee to AFROTC/RRUC. Do not submit the interview form until after the interviewee has accepted or declined the HSSP CS offer. The AF Form 4060 is required in case the applicant decides to turn down the HSSP CS offer later.

+ 3.12.3.5. If an applicant declines the CS offer, the detachment can nominate another applicant provided they have not met an HSSP Board.

##### 3.12.4.{#3_12_4} If the applicant wants to attend a school not affiliated with the interviewing detachment, the interviewing Detachment Commander can, at his/her discretion, contact the desired institution's Detachment Commander and recommend the use of the latter's HSSP CS offer for the applicant. The decision, and responsibility, to tender the offer in a timely manner rests solely with the second Detachment Commander. If the second Detachment Commander offers the CS and it is verbally accepted, he/she will coordinate with the interviewing Detachment Commander who will submit the normal interview forms to AFROTC/RRUC along with the HSSP CS nomination letter which identifies the applicant as a nominee from the second detachment (see Attachment 5). The time from interview to submission of HSSP CS nomination letter should not exceed two weeks without AFROTC/RRUC approval. Delays deprive the applicant the opportunity to compete on a scholarship board should they decline the CS.

##### 3.12.5.{#3_12_5} Upon receipt of the interview results and HSSP CS nomination letter from the Detachment Commander, AFROTC/RRUC will notify the applicant of his/her selection via letter. The applicant will indorse the letter and return to AFROTC/RRUC.

##### 3.12.6.{#3_12_6} If the applicant accepting a HSSP CS offer decides at a later date to attend a different school affiliated with a different detachment, the HSSP CS offer will be withdrawn and the applicant may compete on the next available HSSP board. If this occurs before the 28 February deadline, the detachment will coordinate the declination with HQ AFROTC/RRUC, and the Detachment Commander can then offer the HSSP CS to another applicant who has not met a board no later than 28 February.

----

#### 3.13.{#3_13} DoDMERB Certification of Scholarship Physicals. Periodically, AFROTC/RRUC will provide a listing of HSSP scholarship selectees to DoDMERB. DoDMERB will then schedule the physical examination for each selectee and send the certification of the exam to HQ AFROTC/RRUC.

----

#### 3.14.{#3_14} Medical Waiver Procedures. HQ AETC/SGPS is the waiver authority for all AFROTC physical exams, including scholarship exams. DoDMERB may automatically process a disqualified scholarship physical for waiver based on guidance from AETC/SGPS unless the applicant declines waiver consideration.

----

#### 3.15.{#3_15} In-College Scholarship Program (ICSP).

##### 3.15.1.{#3_15_1} The ICSP is designed to help AFROTC meet officer production goals. ICSP is flexible by design, allowing AFROTC to tailor programs to meet specific officer production needs. The availability of in-college scholarships and incentives is directly linked to production goals, higher headquarters-directed budget considerations and the number of annual scholarship activations from the HSSP and enlisted commissioning programs. The ICSP consists of a series of discrete, computer-based, order of merit-driven selection boards in which nominated cadets compete. With the exception of the Commander's In-College Scholarship (CICS), cadets compete in the ICSP on a national basis. Annually, the AFROTC/CC will determine which, to what extent, and with what constraints ICSP programs will be active. Possible ICSP programs include Express Scholarship Program, Foreign Language Scholarship Program, Historically Black Colleges and Universities Scholarship Program, Hispanic Serving Institution Scholarship Program, Nurse Scholarship Program and Commander's Program (Two-Year Detachments). Once contracted, cadets are no longer eligible for ICSP programs.

##### 3.15.2.{#3_15_2} Prior to nomination, detachments will:

+ 3.15.2.1. Ensure the nominee meets the scholarship eligibility requirements and completes all required actions.

+ 3.15.2.2. Ensure every 3-year nominee for the ICSP will complete all General Military Course (GMC) requirements before entering the POC. Nominees who can complete the GMC through concurrent GMC enrollment or accreditation may apply for a 3-year scholarship. Note: Concurrent enrollment in both the GMC and POC is not authorized.

+ 3.15.2.3. Nominate for applicable scholarship in WINGS. This requirement also applies to walk-on nominees for ICSP Phase 2.

##### 3.15.3.{#3_15_3} Withdrawing Nomination or Offer. Detachments will monitor performance between nomination and activation. Instruct nominees to inform detachment personnel of anything that may affect their scholarship eligibility or activation. If, at any time during this period, a nominee or selectee fails to maintain eligibility and activation standards, withdraw the nomination or offer. Document the withdrawal on an AFROTC Form 16 and update WINGS.

----

#### 3.16.{#3_16} ICSP Eligibility Requirements.

##### 3.16.1.{#3_16_1} To be nominated for a scholarship through ICSP, a cadet must meet the following eligibility requirements:

+ 3.16.1.1. Must have a CGPA of 2.50 or higher

+ 3.16.1.2. Must have a TGPA of 2.50 or higher and have been full-time that term.

	+ 3.16.1.2.1. Grades from summer terms and mini-sessions are counted for CGPA, but not for TGPA requirements.

+ 3.16.1.3. Once a scholarship is activated, a cadet is not eligible for ICSP. Cadets who have lost their scholarship and are permitted to continue in the AFROTC program may compete for another ICSP after going at least one term without a scholarship. In addition, cadets on an activated scholarship cannot "exchange" their current scholarship for a "better" offer (e.g., a cadet on a Type 3 scholarship in Electrical Engineering cannot exchange it for a Type 2 Express Scholarship). The following exceptions apply:

	+ 3.16.1.3.1. A contracted AS100 cadet may terminate his/her HSSP scholarship in writing, be disenrolled, and still be eligible to compete for an ICSP. Include the letter of declination in the cadet's UPRG. Counsel the cadet via AFROTC Form 16 that, if selected, the cadet must go one academic term (fall, winter, or spring) without scholarship funding prior to activation

	+ 3.16.1.3.2. An AS100 HSSP scholarship designee may decline his/her current offer in writing and compete for an ICSP. For example, a 3-Year Type 2 HSSP selectee in a technical major may want to compete for a non-technical scholarship via the ICSP. Include the letter of declination in the cadet's UPRG. Counsel the cadet via AFROTC Form 16 that the original offer cannot be reinstated if he/she is not selected for an ICSP scholarship.

+ 3.16.1.4. Meet AFROTC membership requirements prior to nomination.

+ 3.16.1.5. Meet the AFROTC height/weight (BMI) or Body Fat standards.

+ 3.16.1.6. Meet the AFROTC PFA requirements.

+ 3.16.1.7. Meet the scholarship age requirements.

+ 3.16.1.8. Have a qualified DoDMERB physical examination.

+ 3.16.1.9. Be a U.S. citizen or able to obtain U.S. citizenship by the end of the projected term of activation. NOTE: A scholarship cannot be activated until citizenship is attained. Cadets possessing dual citizenship cannot activate a scholarship or be contracted until they meet the requirements of paragraph 6.4.

##### 3.16.2.{#3_16_2} Present and formerly contracted members of any officer-commissioning program or Service Academy cadets, to include members who leave during their summer training prior to beginning their freshmen year or who attend an academy prep school, must obtain a waiver from AFROTC/RRFA prior to nomination.

##### 3.16.3.{#3_16_3} Cadets under contract in another service ROTC program or any Service Academy, and ANG/AFRES personnel, must obtain a conditional release from their organization prior to nomination.

##### 3.16.4.{#3_16_4} Active duty personnel (including those from other Services) will not be nominated for ICSP until they have been discharged. NOTE: All DD Forms 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, must be verified by AFROTC/RRFA.

##### 3.16.5.{#3_16_5} Review and approve the AFROTC Form 48, or equivalent. Ensure courses listed (including electives) satisfy degree requirements for academic major of nomination.

##### 3.16.6.{#3_16_6} Ensure the academic major is on the desired/mandatory list located on the Holm Center restricted site under the Registrar section.

##### 3.16.7.{#3_16_7} GMC cadets with a suspended or temporarily inactivated scholarship as a result of a disenrollment action are ineligible to re-compete for further scholarship since they are still in contract status.

----

#### 3.17.{#3_17} Commander's In-College Scholarship (CICS) Program.

##### 3.17.1.{#3_17_1} CICS helps AFROTC meet production goals by allowing Detachment/CCs to award scholarships to cadets who they believe have outstanding officer potential and have minimum qualifying SAT-E scores.

##### 3.17.2.{#3_17_2} CICSs are 2.5-, 3-, or 3.5-year offers and CICS cadets are not authorized a freshman option as prescribed in Chapter 12. A nominee for a CICS must be an active AS100, AS200, or AS250 in good academic standing during the fall term (and winter term, if applicable). Ensure CICS nominees SAT-E scores are greater than or equal to1180. The cadets must otherwise meet the scholarship requirements listed in paragraph 3.16.

##### 3.17.3.{#3_17_3} For freshmen receiving a 3.5-year scholarship offer, counsel them via Form 16 that they are not eligible for FSIE, aka "the freshman option."

##### 3.17.4.{#3_17_4} The scholarship should be offered based on an applicant's demonstrated officer potential. As a guide, measures of aptitude, work ethic, leadership ability, bearing, verbal skills, fit with Air Force culture and personal fitness point to officer potential.

##### 3.17.5.{#3_17_5} Scholarships will be awarded using the approved Desired and Mandatory academic majors listed on the Holm Center restricted website under the Registrar section.

----

#### 3.18.{#3_18} In-College Scholarship Program (ICSP) Phases 1 and 2. Nominees for the ICSP boards will normally compete for 2-, 2.5-, 3-, or 3.5-year scholarships.

----

#### 3.19.{#3_19} Nomination Process for ICSP.

##### 3.19.1.{#3_19_1} ICSP is a computer-based, order of merit-driven selection board in which nominated cadets compete on a national basis. ICSP is driven by Air Force accession requirements.

##### 3.19.2.{#3_19_2} AFROTC/RRU will notify detachments via ARMS to submit their qualified ICSP nominees using WINGS. The nomination window will be open as determined by HQ AFROTC/RR. The nomination process consists of two steps: (1) rank order all cadets within their AS year, and (2) nominate only eligible non-scholarship cadets by AS year.

	+ 3.19.2.1.1. The Detachment/CCs will rank-order all of their current cadets by AS class (AS500 cadets will be ranked with the AS200/250 cadets, since they will be attending field training and POC together), whether competing or not, from
#1 to end (or last). Do not include special students. WINGS will compute the Relative Standing Score (RSS) based on the Detachment/CC Ranking (DCR) and the class size. Detachment/CCs should rank cadets based on their officer potential.

	+ 3.19.2.1.2. Do not submit nominees for the scholarship if you do not want them to receive a scholarship.

##### 3.19.3.{#3_19_3} The Detachment/CC will establish procedures to interview and/or evaluate each nominee to help establish the appropriate cadet ranking. Each nominee should be evaluated in terms of the "whole-person" concept, focusing on demonstrated leadership and officer potential, motivation to serve, physical fitness and overall academic performance. The Detachment Commander Ranking (DCR) and subsequent Relative Standing Score (RSS) is a critical aspect of the selection process.

----

#### 3.20.{#3_20} Commander's Scholarship (CS) (Two-Year Detachments).

##### 3.20.1.{#3_20_1} Cadets at Two-Year Detachments are ineligible for ICSP because they have no GMC classes from which to nominate cadets. Therefore the commander of each Two-Year Detachment may nominate two Type 2 scholarships each year. Do not nominate "walk-ons" who have not had the opportunity to demonstrate military potential. Detachment/CCs will submit nominations on separate AFROTC Form 22s to HQ AFROTC/RRFP (requesting an EA and the Type 2 Two-Year detachment CS). Scholarships cannot be activated until approved by HQ AFROTC/RRFP via the AFROTC Form 22.

##### 3.20.2.{#3_20_2} Scholarship nominees must:

+ 3.20.2.1. Meet all nomination requirements.

+ 3.20.2.2. Be an AS300 cadet with an EA.

+ 3.20.2.3. Have been fully evaluated by the Detachment/CC on the "whole person" concept.

+ 3.20.2.4. Have a Scholastic Aptitude Test Equivalency (SAT-E) equal to or greater than 1180.

----

#### 3.21.{#3_21} Express Scholarship Program (EXSP). EXSP is a computer-based, order of merit-driven selection board in which nominated cadets compete on a national basis. EXSP is driven by critical Air Force accession requirements and may be suspended at any time. AFROTC/RRU will announce the requirements, applicable academic majors, and deadlines via ARMS.

+ 3.21.1.1. Express scholarships may be tied to an FY, as well as an academic major or officer accession shortfall, for example, CSO or RPA.

##### 3.21.2.{#3_21_2} Nominees for EXSP must:

+ 3.21.2.1. Meet all eligibility requirements prior to nomination to include a certified DoDMERB.

+ 3.21.2.2. Meet a critical Air Force officer accession requirement as announced by HQ AFROTC/RRU, for example Electrical Engineering

+ 3.21.2.3. Be a non-contract cadet at time of nomination in a specified major and able to graduate in a specific fiscal year-group as announced by HQ AFROTC/RRU.

##### 3.21.3.{#3_21_3} Review the academic plan of each nominee carefully and ensure his/her academic plan is realistic. AFROTC/RRU highly discourages nominating students who will require 18 or more credit hours each term in upper division courses to meet the FY commissioning requirement. These cases will likely result in a request for an extension of the DOC/DOG into the next FY, which will result in loss of their scholarship.

##### 3.21.4.{#3_21_4} Detachment/CCs will submit their nomination via WINGS.

##### 3.21.5.{#3_21_5} EXSP scholarships MUST remain in their fiscal year of graduation. Terminate EXSP scholarships for cadets who cannot graduate in their contracted fiscal year, unless approved by AFROTC/RRU. Submit approval requests through AFROTC Form 22; however, approval of additional entitlements will be the exception and only considered for cases outside of the cadet's control.

----

#### 3.22.{#3_22} Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Scholarship Program.

##### 3.22.1.{#3_22_1} The HBCU program provides the host and cross-town HBCUs with a strong recruiting tool to attract qualified students. Students attending an HBCU may be eligible for a 2- to 3.5-year scholarship. Once activated, these scholarships cannot be transferred to a non-HBCU. If a host HBCU has a cross-town agreement with a non-HBCU institution, cadets attending the non-HBCU are not eligible for HBCU scholarships. HBCU Scholarship program is a computer-based, order of merit-driven selection board. The official list of HBCUs is maintained on the United States Department of Education (Office of Civil Rights Enforcement) website at http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/edlite-minorityinst.html.

##### 3.22.2.{#3_22_2} Nominees must meet all nomination requirements for ICSP.

##### 3.22.3.{#3_22_3} Nominees attending 2-year HBCU schools (Community Colleges) may be awarded an HBCU scholarship while attending a community college / junior college if the host school is also a HBCU and a cross-town agreement is in-place that stipulates that all community college / junior college classes will be accepted at the host (HBCU) institution. Also reference Paragraph 4.29.2.5.4. for information regarding transferring from 2-year HBCU to a non-HBCU senior institution.

----

#### 3.23.{#3_23} Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) Scholarship Program.

##### 3.23.1.{#3_23_1} The HSI program provides host and cross-town HSIs with a strong recruiting tool to attract students. Students attending an HSI may be eligible for a 2- to 3.5-year scholarship. HSI scholarship program is a computer-based, order of merit-driven selection board. Once activated, these scholarships cannot be transferred to non-HSIs. To be considered for an HSI scholarship, the university must be a Title V grant winner. The institutions must be awarded Title V grants to receive HSI designation for AFROTC. The HSI program provides host and cross-town HSIs with a strong recruiting tool to attract qualified students.

##### 3.23.2.{#3_23_2} Nominees must meet all nomination requirements for ICSP.

##### 3.23.3.{#3_23_3} Nominees attending 2-year HSI schools (Community Colleges) may be awarded an HSI scholarship while attending a community college / junior college if the host school is also an HSI and a cross-town or consortium agreement is in-place that stipulates that all community college / junior college classes will be accepted at the host (HSI) institution. Also reference para 4.29.2.5.4., for information regarding transferring from 2-year HSI to a non- HSIU senior institution.

##### 3.23.4.{#3_23_4} These universities are considered HSIs for AFROTC only while they have current Title V grants. Det commanders need to ensure the Title V grants are active.

----

#### 3.24.{#3_24} Cadet Training Assistant Scholarship (CTAS).

##### 3.24.1.{#3_24_1} The CTAS is a scholarship earned by contracted cadets who have demonstrated successful completion of leadership assignment as a Cadet Training Assistant (CTA) at AFROTC field training, as long as they meet ROTC academic and military retention standards. CTAS may be recouped if a cadet is disenrolled. CTAS is not authorized to cadets with a suspended scholarship. Non-contract cadets are not authorized CTAS payments, but they may serve as a CTA. The CTAS can be used to supplement conventional scholarship, e.g., pay over the cap of an established scholarship. CTAS can only be paid for the academic year immediately following the summer a cadet performed CTA duty. The CTAS is limited to tuition, fees and books. The award is limited to a maximum of $2,000 and when combined with other active scholarships (incrementally, up to $1,000/semester or $666/quarter) can be paid up to the maximum cost (combined tuition, fees and books) and only applies to an unpaid balance in the student's tuition/books account. CTAS cannot be combined into one term. It must be divided up to
$1,000/semester or $666/quarter, no exceptions. If a cadet is unable/ineligible to use the supplement in the fall, any remaining supplement may be used the following term(s) if retention standards are met IAW Chapter 4 of this instruction. CTAS for tuition must reflect on the tuition invoice. CTAS for textbooks are processed in WINGS and paid directly to the student. If the CTA is sent home from FT at any time for disciplinary reasons, then coordinate with AFROTC/RRU prior to CTAS activation. Based on the reason the CTA was sent home and the recommendation of the FTU/CC, the scholarship offer may be withdrawn.

##### 3.24.2.{#3_24_2} Scholarship age restrictions apply.

##### 3.24.3.{#3_24_3} Cadets who will enter into extended status are only eligible for the CTAS if they are in a SAF-approved 5-year major.

##### 3.24.4.{#3_24_4} Scholarship Cadets. The cadet must sign a memorandum containing the following statement: "I understand that CTAS is a supplement to normal scholarship entitlements and, like other scholarship entitlements, may be recouped should I fail to commission." Maintain the memorandum in the UPRG. There is no requirement to forward this letter to HQ AFROTC.

##### 3.24.5.{#3_24_5} Non-Scholarship Cadets. Initiate a contract change page and update the scholarship type to "CTAS" and the length to 2 Semesters/3 Quarters prior to processing the tuition invoice.

##### 3.24.6.{#3_24_6} CTAS will be loaded by HQ AFROTC/RRUE and the money will be added to tuition estimates in WINGS.

##### 3.24.7.{#3_24_7} Cadets receiving a scholarship that covers the entire cost of their tuition and fees are not authorized to receive CTAS. They may, however, utilize CTAS to cover any book costs above the amount authorized by their scholarship. If the CTAS will be utilized to pay for any textbooks, the detachment must collect receipts for all textbooks from the student prior to authorizing an increase in textbook entitlements. The detachment must keep copies of these receipts in the cadet's UPRG for the duration of the cadet's AFROTC membership.

##### 3.24.8.{#3_24_8} The CTAS may be used for summer tuition provided the summer session is after CTA duty and all POC standards are met. CTAS funding for summer coursework must be approved via AFROTC Form 22 package to AFROTC/RRFA.

##### 3.24.9.{#3_24_9} Ensure the cadet understands the impact the CTAS payment might have on their Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) eligibility prior to acceptance via counseling. The CTAS is considered "scholarship funding" for MGIB purposes (reference Title 38, USC Section 3011(c) (3) (B), for further information on MGIB education benefits eligibility). Cadets are eligible for the MGIB if they receive $3,400 or less in scholarship benefits in any one year on scholarship.

##### 3.24.10.{#3_24_10} Late replacements for CTAs will be added to the scholarship list as vetted by region commanders. Region commanders will notify AFROTC/DOX of any changes to CTA duty.

----

#### 3.25.{#3_25} ICSP Nurse Scholarships.

##### 3.25.1.{#3_25_1} ICSP Nurse scholarship cadets must be pursuing a nursing major and planning on acceptance into a nursing program at a school where the major is accredited by either the National League of Nursing (NLN) or the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE). Detachment commanders must counsel nurse candidates on this policy via AFROTC Form 16.

##### 3.25.2.{#3_25_2} ICSP Nurse scholarship cadets who fail to gain acceptance into the certified nursing program will lose their scholarship and will have to request a non-technical EA to remain in AFROTC.

----

#### 3.26.{#3_26} Scholarship Action Dates. Scholarships can only be activated during normal school terms, i.e. not during summer or mini-sessions. For exceptions, see Chapter 6, paragraph 6.9.

----

#### 3.27.{#3_27} Temporary Inactivation / Reactivation of Scholarships.

##### 3.27.1.{#3_27_1} The purpose of temporary inactivation is to protect government funds in situations that may result in scholarship suspension or termination, or in disenrollment from AFROTC.

##### 3.27.2.{#3_27_2} Temporarily inactivate a scholarship whenever a cadet's scholarship continuation, or a cadet's retention in AFROTC, is in jeopardy. Examples of such situations include, but are not limited to, serious civil involvements, significant changes in medical status, or conduct that is incompatible with military service. The temporary inactivation date is the date the commander decided to inactivate the scholarship (this date can be a date prior to the date the cadet was counseled and signed the AFROTC Form 16). Once the issue is resolved, reactivate the scholarship, suspend, terminate, or disenroll, as appropriate.

##### 3.27.3.{#3_27_3} If the cadet's scholarship is reactivated, the reactivation date is the day after the original temporary inactivation date. Thus GMC cadet stipend would not be adversely impacted.

----

#### 3.28.{#3_28} Suspending Scholarships.

##### 3.28.1.{#3_28_1} Scholarships must be suspended when directed by AFROTC instructions. In addition, the Detachment/CC or AFROTC/RR may direct suspension of a scholarship even though current instruction directs less severe action. That is, the Detachment/CC may suspend a scholarship any time a cadet's actions warrant suspension.

##### 3.28.2.{#3_28_2} Once a scholarship is suspended, it is suspended for the entire term. Each suspension results in an unfunded term for the cadet. If AFROTC has already been obligated for the suspended term (e.g., suspension occurred after the 45th day of the fall term), the next term will be unfunded. If another CE occurs during an already suspended term, and if that CE directs another suspension, the detachment must suspend the scholarship for another term.

##### 3.28.3.{#3_28_3} If the suspension occurs after the 45th day (fall term only) or after the pecuniary liability date (all other terms), the financial impact of the suspension will take effect the following term. The suspension date, however, will be the day of the infraction, or, if already temporarily inactivated, the last day of the term of host institution classes. NOTE: For cadets in their final term of entitlement, the tuition payment for the current term is not affected if the suspension occurs after the pecuniary liability date.

##### 3.28.4.{#3_28_4} Scholarship suspensions require loss of funds for a full term. The lost funds cannot be recovered at a later date and the suspended term counts toward total authorized entitlements. After one term in suspended status, a cadet's scholarship may be reinstated IAW retention standards.

----

#### 3.29.{#3_29} Scholarship Termination.

##### 3.29.1.{#3_29_1} The Detachment/CC or HQ AFROTC may direct termination of a POC cadet's scholarship for failure to meet standards, or when a suspension is not considered to be in the best interest of the Air Force.

##### 3.29.2.{#3_29_2} When Chapter 4, Table 4.1 or other circumstance requires termination of a POC cadet's scholarship, the detachment must terminate the scholarship and initiate an investigation for disenrollment. POC cadets will continue to receive a stipend while still an active member of AFROTC. Stipend will be terminated even though disenrollment has not been finalized if a POC cadet stops attending, or is removed from, AS classes. (See HOLMCENTERI 65-101, The AFROTC Cadet Payment Programs).

##### 3.29.3.{#3_29_3} When Chapter 4, Table 4.1 or other circumstance requires termination of an AS100 or AS200 cadet's scholarship, the detachment must temporarily inactivate the scholarship and initiate an investigation for disenrollment. GMC cadets will not receive stipend payments when their scholarship is suspended or terminated. (See HOLMCENTERI 65- 101).

+ 3.29.3.1. By law, GMC cadets may be on contract only if on scholarship.

##### 3.29.4.{#3_29_4} The Detachment/CC must initiate scholarship termination for the following conditions:

+ 3.29.4.1. When directed by HQ AFROTC.

+ 3.29.4.2. Death of the cadet.

+ 3.29.4.3. When a scholarship cadet voluntarily removes himself/herself from the scholarship program (e.g., declines or relinquishes the scholarship, etc.).

##### 3.29.5.{#3_29_5} The Detachment/CC will temporarily inactivate the scholarship for the following:

+ 3.29.5.1. When a scholarship cadet changes academic major without approval.

+ 3.29.5.2. When a scholarship cadet transfers to a different school without approval.

+ 3.29.5.3. When a scholarship cadet indicates intent not to complete the GMC, to attend FT, or to enter/complete the POC. Counsel the cadet via an AFROTC Form 16, obtain a written statement from the cadet, and file both in the cadet's UPRG.

+ 3.29.5.4. When a scholarship cadet expends all of his/her scholarship entitlements, completion date is the last day of the term.

##### 3.29.6.{#3_29_6} For all other scholarship termination actions refer to Chapter 4, Table 4.1.

#### 3.30.{#3_30} Academic Degree Accreditation Requirements.

##### 3.30.1.{#3_30_1} All accreditation requirements are based on AFI 36-2005, Appointment in Commissioned Grades and Designation and Assignment in Professional Categories— Reserve of the Air Force and United States Air Force, and AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted). In order to qualify for technical scholarship funding, a cadet's degree program must be judged by the Air Force Personnel Center as qualifying a cadet to be accessed into a technical AFSC and accredited as below:

+ 3.30.1.1. Engineering majors must be accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC), which is a commission that acts under the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). See www.abet.org to validate the status of the program at a specific school.

	+ 3.30.1.1.1. Many ABET-accredited engineering programs offer options or concentrations under an ABET-accredited "umbrella" program. In many cases, these options are not ABET-accredited (e.g., an ABET-accredited General Engineering degree that offers three non-certified options in electrical, mechanical, and computer engineering, respectively). "Options" or "emphasis areas" under a broader-titled degree that is ABET-accredited are considered accredited only for the actual degree tendered by the institution. For example, if an ABET-accredited General Engineering program offers an option in electrical engineering, but the degree tendered by the university is a Bachelor of Science in General Engineering (Electrical emphasis), the student will be considered in "General Engineering" for AFROTC purposes.

		+ 3.30.1.1.1.1. For Engineering, Architecture, Pharmacy, and Nursing, if a degree is not accredited, the cadet will NOT qualify for SAF 5th year entitlements.

		+ 3.30.1.1.1.2. Non-ABET-accredited Engineering, and Architecture programs will NOT be approved as technical degrees for AFROTC. Cadets will compete for non-technical or rated enrollment allocations and non-technical scholarships.

	+ 3.30.1.1.2. The program must be separately accredited by ABET for any "emphasis" or "option" programs to qualify under their unique title for AFROTC purposes.

+ 3.30.1.2. The following majors must be properly accredited, without exception, by the listed agencies:

	+ 3.30.1.2.1. Meteorology/Atmospheric Science (8FYY) majors must be reviewed at least every five (5) years by AFIT/ENEL to validate accreditation of the program. The major must be reviewed by AFIT immediately if any program changes occur that may impact the program accreditation. Detachments must submit review requests directly to AFIT/ENEL, 2950 Hobson Way, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433. To initiate the periodic review, send the host/crosstown university's course catalogue and descriptions to ENELGradEdDivision@AFIT.edu. AFIT/ENEL will return the completed evaluation directly to the detachment. Detachments will retain the completed evaluation received from AFIT and suspense next review. AFIT/ENEL can be contacted at commercial (937) 255-2259 ext. 3003 or DSN 785-2259 ext. 3003.

	+ 3.30.1.2.2. Architecture (2CAY) majors accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB).

	+ 3.30.1.2.3. Nursing (7EAI, 7EAY, 7EYY) majors accredited by the National League of Nursing (NLN) or the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE). In addition, nursing majors accredited by the Department of Education approved boards are also acceptable.

	+ 3.30.1.2.4. Pharmacy (7ABV) majors accredited by the American Council on Pharmaceutical Education (ACPE).

	+ 3.30.1.2.5. Physical Therapy (7ABO) majors accredited by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education.

	+ 3.30.1.2.6. Occupational Therapy (7ABK) majors accredited by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy (ACOTE).

+ 3.30.1.3. All other majors must be offered by schools that are accredited by one of the six regional accrediting associations and listed in the current Accredited Institutions of Postsecondary Education Directory (published by the American Council on Education), or the latest edition of the Higher Education Directory (published by Higher Education Publications, Inc.), or any other education publication which clearly indicates regional accreditation. It is the responsibility of each AFROTC detachment to review and verify the proper accreditation of its schools' academic programs under this policy.

+ 3.30.1.4. Detachments associated with schools accredited by the appropriate agency will maintain documentation (course catalog, departmental letter, etc.) identifying the accreditation and review it at least every five (5) years. Annotate this review via a memo for record and maintain it in the files until the next review.

+ 3.30.1.5. Majors not addressed by an accredited agency (such as unique or combination majors) may be sent to HQ AFROTC/RRU for approval. Requests should include all coursework requirements. Include comparisons to similar accredited majors at the same institution.

----

#### 3.31.{#3_31} Additional Terms of Entitlements.

##### 3.31.1.{#3_31_1} The purpose of additional entitlements is to fund cadets in the 5th year of an undergraduate academic major provided the SAF has approved the major for 5th-year funding. AFROTC Form 88, Extended Terms of Scholarship Entitlements Acknowledgement and Certification, is the source document for additional scholarship entitlements and the associated Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC). Additional term funding is authorized only after completion of the last AS classes and only for 5-year SAF-approved majors. Initiate the AFROTC Form 88 Section I the day of, but prior to, enlistment (except as indicated in the note below) for scholarship cadets in a SAF-approved 5-year undergraduate major who are activating either a 4-yr or 3.5-yr scholarship. Completing Section I of the AFROTC Form 88 does not automatically qualify a cadet for additional terms of entitlements. Cadets cannot take the 5th year of entitlement (for SAF-approved 5- year majors) to condense their baccalaureate degree academics and use scholarship entitlements during the fifth year for graduate-level work. Once AFROTC classes and baccalaureate degree requirements are complete, the cadet should commission. NOTE: When a scholarship cadet enlists as an 0GYY or other non-tech major and later changes major to a SAF-approved 5-year major, initiate Section I of the AFROTC Form 88 the day of, but prior to, completing the change page to the contract.

##### 3.31.2.{#3_31_2} Extended scholarship entitlements are additional scholarship entitlements added on to a 4-year HSSP scholarship. Extended entitlements are limited to 5 total years of entitlements (10 semesters or 15 quarters). Activation of extended scholarship entitlements incurs an additional ADSC and requires the AFROTC Form 88.

##### 3.31.3.{#3_31_3} Adjusted scholarship entitlements are additional scholarship entitlements granted to cadets with scholarships of less than 4 years and will incur an additional ADSC if the entitlements exceed 8 semesters / 12 quarters. Adjusted entitlements that exceed the 4 years (8 semesters / 12 quarters) of entitlements require the AFROTC Form 88 and an additional ADSC will be incurred.

##### 3.31.4.{#3_31_4} Eligibility for additional term(s) of entitlements requires the following of scholarship cadets:

+ 3.31.4.1. Already be enrolled in a SAF-approved 5-year academic major listed in Attachment 8.

+ 3.31.4.2. Be certified by the Detachment/CC as requiring more than 4 years with the normal academic load (including AFROTC courses.) A normal load is at least 12 semester/quarter hours per term (15 hours is recommended), or the institutional requirement for full-time student status.

+ 3.31.4.3. Have a CGPA of at least 2.5 at time of award.

+ 3.31.4.4. Not exceed the maximum age limits to receive scholarship funds.

+ 3.31.4.5. Continue in full-time student status during the 5th year, except for the final term before graduation/commissioning.

##### 3.31.5.{#3_31_5} The Detachment/CC must notify AFROTC/RRUE via letter that they have awarded additional entitlements to a qualifying cadet. Eligible candidates must be submitted prior to the completion of their original scholarship award, usually during the spring term of the AS400 year.

+ 3.31.5.1. Prepare a letter with the following information identified: Cadet's name, EMPLID, length of scholarship, and the number of terms granted.

+ 3.31.5.2. Cadets who extend past 4 years (8 semesters / 12 quarters) of entitlements must complete AFROTC Form 88, Section II, Cadet Acceptance, no earlier than 10 days prior to the cadet entering the first day of classes of the 5th academic year. Complete Section III, Termination of Extended Scholarship Entitlements, when entitlements are terminated and forward it along with the commissioning documents.

----

#### 3.32.{#3_32} Scholarship Entitlements.

##### 3.32.1.{#3_32_1} Scholarship entitlements are limited to the number of terms prescribed in the scholarship authority source document or the number of terms required to complete AS academic requirements, whichever occurs first, unless additional terms are awarded. The number of terms authorized is limited to a maximum of 4 academic years (8 semesters or 12 quarters) for 4-year program members, 3 academic years (6 semesters or 9 quarters) for 3- year program members or 2 academic years (4 semesters or 6 quarters) for 2-year program members. Any half-year scholarship offers equate to only one additional term (1 semester or 1 quarter).

##### 3.32.2.{#3_32_2} Scholarship entitlements end upon completion of AS course requirements, unless additional terms are authorized in paragraph 3.31.

##### 3.32.3.{#3_32_3} When additional terms of entitlements are authorized, the number of terms of scholarship entitlements authorized may not exceed 1 academic year after the completion of AS classes.

----

#### 3.33.{#3_33} Funding for Summer School and Mini-Sessions.

##### 3.33.1.{#3_33_1} Funding for these courses is not programmed in the student's authorized terms of entitlements. Funding approval must be received from AFROTC/RRUE prior to the start of the summer term (no exceptions). All cadets should be counseled on the ramifications of attending these courses. Funding for mandatory classes required for degree completion and only offered during the summer does not equal a normal term of entitlement. In other words, it does not subtract from terms of entitlements already programmed; however, when added with funding already expended on the cadet during the current fiscal year, summer funding cannot exceed the annual cap for the cadet's scholarship type, unless specifically approved by AFROTC/RRF.

##### 3.33.2.{#3_33_2} Funding for summer school and mini-sessions is only authorized when attendance is mandatory for all students in that major or school and the coursework is only offered in the summer. Classes and/or sessions cannot take place at a different school than the one the cadet attends. Tuition and fees for the current academic year combined with the cost for requested summer entitlements cannot exceed the annual limit based on the scholarship type.

+ 3.33.2.1. Funding for summer courses are authorized when the academic major requires year-round attendance (e.g., some nursing programs).

+ 3.33.2.2. The detachment may request funding for mandatory courses by submitting a Form 22 request to RRFA. Include the scholarship type and the amount AFROTC spent on tuition and fees for the current academic year by term.

##### 3.33.3.{#3_33_3} Courses offered during the normal school year but need to be taken by the cadet to maintain their DOC/DOG or lighten their academic load will not be funded.

##### 3.33.4.{#3_33_4} Some universities require a minimum mandatory summer attendance with no specific courses required. Such requirements are not covered by scholarship.

----

#### 3.34.{#3_34} Authorized Tuition and Fee Entitlements.

##### 3.34.1.{#3_34_1} These are limited to tuition and fees associated with required and elective courses. A required course is a prerequisite for further advancement in the cadet's contracted major. An elective course is one required to meet graduation requirements, but where the cadet has latitude in actual course selection. For a required course, AFROTC will also pay mandatory institutional fees that are incurred by all students. AFROTC will not pay fees not authorized by the Education Service Agreement (ESA) or personal fees not required of all students. AFROTC will only pay fees for an elective course when it is clearly academic in origin. The Detachment/CC determines if the course directly contributes to officer development and it is in the best interest of the Air Force and signs the commander statement (reference Figure 3.1.) to indicate these conditions have been met.

##### 3.34.2.{#3_34_2} Reimbursement is authorized for tuition and the following fees:

+ 3.34.2.1. Registration and matriculation fees.

+ 3.34.2.2. Laboratory fees and non-refundable deposits.

+ 3.34.2.3. Cost of special fees and computer time. NOTE: Reimbursement of computer time is not authorized if it is related to student research.

+ 3.34.2.4. Cost of a College Level Examination Program (CLEP) test that replaces a required course if the test is passed and accepted for credit toward degree requirements by the institution. Student must be on scholarship at the time of the test.

+ 3.34.2.5. Costs of a course taken to meet AFROTC requirements.

+ 3.34.2.6. Costs of course overloads are authorized, but are limited to:

	+ 3.34.2.6.1. Those required for reasonable progress toward degree completion. 3.34.2.6.2. Those that result from prerequisite requirements.

	+ 3.34.2.6.3. Those required as a result of changes in curriculum made by the institution.

	+ 3.34.3.6.4. Institutional transfers for the purpose of initial scholarship activation. 3.34.2.6.5. Scholarship continuation resulting from detachment inactivation.

	+ 3.34.2.6.6. Courses missed due to an injury or illness. Institutional authorities and the Detachment/CC must approve the absence.

+ 3.34.2.7. Fees for health, student activity, athletic, library, student union, student publication costs, and similar fees required of all students enrolled in the institution. Payment of university health fees is authorized if it is mandatory for all students whether or not they have alternative insurance. If the university provides an option to either pay a university health fee or maintain their own private insurance, then payment of such fees are authorized if the cadet chooses the university's plan.

+ 3.34.2.8. Graduation, diploma, and cap and gown fees. NOTE: Fees must be billed through the university.

+ 3.34.2.9. Cost of transportation required of all students.

+ 3.34.2.10. Costs for up to 5 distance learning/correspondence courses per academic year. A distance learning course (non-traditional academic class that includes a method of direct interaction among students and instructor) must be accepted and/or offered by the cadet's host institution and begin/end within the academic term.

+ 3.34.2.11. Authorized classes for which AFROTC has not paid previously.

----

#### 3.35.{#3_35} Tuition and Fees Not Authorized.

##### 3.35.1.{#3_35_1} Detachments must advise scholarship applicants or cadets that reimbursement is not authorized to defray costs of the following programs or services listed:

+ 3.35.1.1. Payment for any type of flying course where a cadet "gets into the air" or has additional fees associated with actual flying activities, such as aircraft rental or instructor time. Cadets may take these courses if they meet degree requirements but they will pay the extraordinary fees (i.e., all costs associated with flying training must be paid by the student). If these costs are combined with tuition and fees, they must be itemized and the cadet becomes responsible for their payment.

+ 3.35.1.2. Special expenses associated with field trips.

+ 3.35.1.3. Expenses for optional projects, personal equipment (including personal computers), and supplies.

+ 3.35.1.4. Special fees for social activities.

+ 3.35.1.5. Yearbooks.

+ 3.35.1.6. Gym lockers and laundry fees.

+ 3.35.1.7. Courses not required by the catalog as a degree requirement. Detachments must ensure that cadet academic plans accurately reflect required courses for degree completion. Courses that do not count as a requirement or elective toward overall degree completion in the contracted major are not authorized for payment by AFROTC.

+ 3.35.1.8. Equipment, equipment rental, and material costs, and those scholarship restrictions identified in the reenlistment briefing.

+ 3.35.1.9. Secretarial and legal training which the National Defense Authorization Act restricts.

+ 3.35.1.10. Costs of course overloads resulting from: 3.35.1.10.1. Courses not required for a degree.

	+ 3.35.1.10.2. Failures, incompletes, withdrawals, add/drop, etc. 3.35.1.10.3. Changes in academic major.

+ 3.35.1.11. Transfers made at the discretion of the individual.

+ 3.35.1.12. Penalties or fines for late registration or makeup examinations.

+ 3.35.1.13. Additional costs associated with term abroad studies or similar programs.

+ 3.35.1.14. Payment of suspended or inactivated terms.

+ 3.35.1.15. Cost of repeat or remedial courses previously attempted as a scholarship cadet. Retaken courses count toward full-time status, but may NOT be funded.

	+ 3.35.1.15.1. If the institution bills by the course or course hour, the scholarship cadet pays for all remedial or repeat courses.

	+ 3.35.1.15.2. If the institution has a fixed fee for full-time students, the cadet must take enough new classes to equal the minimum load required to attain full- time student status or must pay on a prorated basis for remedial or repeated classes. For example, if at least 12 hours is required to attain full-time student status at a fixed cost of $10,000 per term, the Air Force will pay the full cost for the cadet who takes 12 hours of new courses and 3 hours of remedial or repeat classes for a total of 15 hours. On the other hand, a cadet who takes 9 hours of new classes and 6 hours of remedial or repeated classes will receive only 9/12 of the $10,000 fee ($7,500). For capped scholarships, figure 9/12 of TOTAL tuition for the term. If the result is more than the capped amount, pay the capped amount. If the result is less than the capped amount, pay the lesser amount. The cadet must pay the difference. For example, if a Type 2 scholarship cadet takes 10 new credit hours and 3 repeat credit hours, 10/12 of $10,000 is $8,333. The cadet would receive the normal $7,500 scholarship. If the cadet takes 8 new credit hours, 8/12 of $10,000 is $6,667. Pay only $6,667 of the $7,500 scholarship.

+ 3.35.1.16. Costs of parking fees.

+ 3.35.1.17. Additional academic expenses not authorized as scholarship entitlements and identified in the pre-enlistment briefing.

+ 3.35.1.18. Costs incurred obtaining a professional license to include certification or exam fees.

+ 3.35.1.19. Cost of immunizations and malpractice insurance, even though required of students.

+ 3.35.1.20. Additional fees associated with a recreational-type elective course (e.g., equipment rental fee for a scuba course, equipment rental fees/lift tickets for a skiing course), even if the institution directly bills them.

+ 3.35.1.21. NOTE: When a refund is due to the government from either a student or the university, the check or money order should be made out to Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) and forwarded along with a letter of explanation, to include the cadet's name, EMPLID, SSN, term, and fiscal year from the detachment to Holm Center/SDFA, ATTN: Scholarship Clerk, 130 W. Maxwell Blvd, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-5937.

----

#### 3.36.{#3_36} Textbook Reimbursement Entitlement for Scholarship Program. Cadets on scholarship will receive an annual flat rate for textbooks. AFROTC/RR will determine the flat-rate textbook amounts each academic year and any changes in rates will be forwarded to the detachments by separate letter. NOTE: The annual flat rate amount for textbooks will be paid each term. Cadets attending semester schools will receive one-half of the annual amounts each term. Cadets attending quarter schools will receive one-third of the annual amount each term. Flat rate textbook reimbursements will not be made for summer terms. Textbook payments are not authorized when the scholarship is not active (e.g., suspended or completed). Procedures for textbook reimbursement are outlined in the WINGS User Guide.

----

#### 3.37.{#3_37} Payment or Termination of Scholarship Entitlements.

##### 3.37.1.{#3_37_1} Provide institutions a list of cadets who are expected to receive scholarship payments prior to each term and notify them of any scholarship suspension, termination or temporary inactivation to include the effective date. Each notification must include the Educational Service Agreement (ESA) number.

##### 3.37.2.{#3_37_2} Ensure WINGS reflects the cadet's correct scholarship status. When institutions receive notification, they are authorized to either claim reimbursement (as prescribed in the ESA) or terminate the university's incentives associated with a cadet's scholarship status. Review procedures in regarding temporary inactivation, suspension and termination. If a prorated share of tuition is due as of a termination date, ensure the institution is advised the cadet is responsible for any excess tuition.

##### 3.37.3.{#3_37_3} Ensure the invoice submitted by the institution is reduced to the prorated amount. Tuition and fee payments may not be authorized for the Fall term if the scholarship or incentive is temporarily inactivated, suspended or terminated prior to the close of business on the 45th day from the school start date. Temporarily inactivated scholarships or incentives reactivated before the end of the term will be paid.

##### 3.37.4.{#3_37_4} Ensure cadet is counseled via AFROTC Form 16 on changes in his/her scholarship status.

----

#### 3.38.{#3_38} Non-Duplication of Financial Aid Programs. Most federal assistance programs have a duplication clause that prohibits receipt of educational benefits from more than one source. A scholarship selectee receiving such benefits should check with the agency concerned to determine whether the duplication clause applies. Students may receive scholarship entitlements and Veterans Administration benefits simultaneously. Scholarship recipients should inform their financial aid offices that they are on AFROTC scholarships. If tuition, fees, or any part thereof are paid by any source, (e.g., a state scholarship that will pay tuition), AFROTC will not duplicate payment.

----

#### 3.39.{#3_39} 45-Day Rule. The 45-day requirement applies only to the fall term. All scholarship tuition, fees, and textbooks must be billed against the next fiscal year as of the 45th calendar day of institutional classes. Scholarship cadets must be enrolled in AFROTC and in an active status at close of business on the 45th day of classes (at each school) or after but not later than the last day of the term at the institution of attendance in order for AFROTC to pay tuition and fees. The 45-day rule applies to each institution a cadet attends if the institution charges for the course or courses. Scholarships that have not been activated by the last day of the term will be withdrawn, unless a prior waiver is obtained from HQ AFROTC/RRFA.

----

#### 3.40.{#3_40} Tuition Entries into WINGS.

##### 3.40.1.{#3_40_1} The office of primary responsibility (OPR) for this paragraph is AFROTC/RRU.

##### 3.40.2.{#3_40_2} Detachments must enter into WINGS estimated costs for tuition, fees, and laboratory expenses (ascertained from the institutional Bursar or Comptroller) for each academic term of the current academic year. Report all active, temporarily inactivated, and awarded scholarship cadets. Tuition estimates must be entered for all terms for cadets anticipated to activate during current academic year. Data entered is used to verify membership, estimate budget requirements, and to monitor scholarship costs.

##### 3.40.3.{#3_40_3} Enter estimates for each term of the current AY by 1 September. Do not include cadets in extended status unless Section II of the AFROTC Form 88 is completed (cadets receiving more than 4 years of scholarship entitlements only) or the additional entitlements memorandum is completed. Provide the memorandum to AFROTC/RRUE who in turn, will load the additional terms of entitlements in WINGS.

##### 3.40.4.{#3_40_4} For new scholarship appointments, enter estimates for each term of the current AY within 5 workdays of the activation.

##### 3.40.5.{#3_40_5} Any changes to the original estimate must be made within 5 workdays of the change. Examples of changes are:

+ 3.40.5.1. Approved additional terms of scholarship entitlements not previously reported.

+ 3.40.5.2. Deleted term due to suspension, non-attendance, transfer, or scholarship termination.

+ 3.40.5.3. If there is an estimate in the system for a cadet who will not be paid for a term (e.g., temporarily inactivated cadets who have not been reinstated by the time the term has ended) access the Tuition Estimates Update screen in WINGS and check the "Billed in Full" box.

##### 3.40.6.{#3_40_6} Include graduation fees in the scholarship estimate for the applicable term of entitlement up to, and not to exceed, the annual scholarship cap IAW the scholarship type.

##### 3.40.7.{#3_40_7} AECP/NECP Students. Estimates for the following fall term must be entered by the end of the previous spring term since their tuition is paid with current FY funds and they do not require the 45-day waiting period.

----

#### 3.41.{#3_41} Processing Scholarship Invoices for Reimbursement.

##### 3.41.1.{#3_41_1} The Detachment/CC is responsible for establishing procedures for verifying and approving institutional invoices for scholarship reimbursement before submitting them to Holm Center/SDFA for payment. No cadet can be submitted for payment until they are in an active status. The Detachment/CC is responsible for contacting the appropriate institution officials when invoices are not received for processing within 60 days after the beginning of the first term of the academic year or 30 days after the beginning of subsequent terms. Detachments must maintain records of attempts to obtain invoices from institutions.

##### 3.41.2.{#3_41_2} The following guidelines will ensure accurate scholarship processing.

+ 3.41.2.1. Upon receipt of the institutional invoices contact Holm Center/SDFA for a Bill ID. Date stamp and annotate on invoice "Detachment XXX received on XXXX."

+ 3.41.2.2. Verify each invoice. Ensure students listed are contracted and in an active scholarship status.

+ 3.41.2.3. Ensure each academic term total tuition and fees for a cadet under a capped scholarship do not exceed the maximum cost threshold established for the academic term being billed. The approved maximum term cost thresholds are:Table 3.1. Scholarship Type/Caps.Scholarship Type Semester Quarter or TrimesterType 1 / 1U Uncapped UncappedType 2 $9,000 $6,000Type 3 $4,500 $3,000Type 6 $1,500 $1,000Type 7 At institution in-state rate At institution in-state rateCTAS $1,000 $666

+ 3.41.2.4. Ensure no portion of the invoice has been previously submitted for payment.

+ 3.41.2.5. Ensure charges do not include unauthorized expenses; e.g., repeat courses, flight operations, personal equipment or services. (Some fees may not be authorized for payment even if the fees are charged to all students taking the same course.)

+ 3.41.2.6. Ensure invoice prices agree with rates contained in applicable university publications or correspondence. Verify each line item to ensure proper pricing. Before authorizing payment for out-of-state tuition, verify the student does not qualify for in- state tuition. All invoices must be on "letterhead" from the university that is billing for the tuition and fees. If a cross-town does not have an Educational Service Agreement (ESA), the billing institution is the host school. If changes are necessary, contact the institution for a new invoice with a current date.

+ 3.41.2.7. Ensure the invoice is from the institution where payment is to be sent. The invoice cannot be from one school with payment to another. Invoices from cross-town schools without an ESA must be forwarded to the host institution and the host institution will bill for expenses. As part of the ESA, the host institution will bill and reimburse the third party once payment is received.

+ 3.41.2.8. Ensure all cadets listed on the invoice are in WINGS. Do not include payment for cadets whose scholarships are temporarily inactivated or suspended in WINGS.NOTE: If, as of the Pecuniary Liability Date (the date the government is liable for the tuition bill) the cadet scholarship is in an active status, tuition must be paid.

+ 3.41.2.9. Ensure a staff member reviews all invoices for scholarship cadets and compares the curriculum or number of credit hours specified on the invoice with the cadet's AFROTC Form 48. In cases where curriculum and credit hour information is not provided, control scholarship entitlements by maintaining an updated academic plan and conducting personal interviews with the cadet. Use this management control to ensure:

	+ 3.41.2.9.1. The cadet is maintaining full-time student status. 3.41.2.9.2. The cadet is following the academic plan.

	+ 3.41.2.9.3. Payments are not made for unauthorized courses.

	+ 3.41.2.9.4. The cadet's in-state or out-of-state tuition rate is accurate and out-of-state tuition rates are not paid for any student entitled to in-state tuition rates.

+ 3.41.2.10. Ensure the correct ESA number appears on ALL invoices.

+ 3.41.2.11. The invoice is certified for payment by the Detachment/CC signing the Commander's Statement (do not change the wording of the statement in Figure 3.1), as required by DFAS DE 7010.5. Invoices received by Holm Center/SDFA without this statement will be returned to the detachment. Maintain this statement on a separate sheet of paper and reference the invoice/invoices being paid.

	+ 3.41.2.11.1. Detachments have 5 calendar days to process an invoice; Holm Center/SDFA has 5 calendar days to process an invoice; and DFAS has 18 calendar days to make payment.

	+ 3.41.2.11.2. When putting date received in the Commander's Statements, calculate from the current date to figure when the payment can be made. If the expected pay date is during the term, the received date is the date Holm Center/SDFA or the detachment first received the invoice. The accepted date may be the same date as the received date or may be a later date, but no more than 5 days after the received date. (If detachment received invoice prior to Holm Center/SDFA, then the received date would be the date the detachment received it.)

	+ 3.41.2.11.3. If the expected pay date is after the term will end, the received date must be the last day of the term. The accepted date may be the same date as the received date or may be no more than 5 days after the received date.

	+ 3.41.2.11.4. Ensure invoice number assigned by WINGS is listed on each page of the invoice as "Payee Number" (must read "Payee Number XXXXXXXXX").

	+ 3.41.2.11.5. Ensure term start and stop dates are listed on each page of the invoice.

##### 3.41.3.{#3_41_3} Charges on the invoice for each cadet are entered in WINGS by accessing the "Build Invoice" screen.

##### 3.41.4.{#3_41_4} Holm Center/SDFA must have a breakdown of charges for each course and fee unless the institution charges by a flat rate (reference Attachment 9). The invoice must be a consolidated invoice when submitted for payment. An example of an invoice was attached to the contract provided to the university. If a university is not following the guidance provided, ask them to adopt the invoice format.

##### 3.41.7.{#3_41_7} Submit the invoice, the Build Invoice screen shot from WINGS, and the SF 1034 (reference Attachment 10) to Holm Center/SDFA. Payee's name and address must appear exactly as indicated on the invoice. The university name must be on the first line. NOTE: When making corrections on the school invoice, draw one line through the item to be corrected, make the change, and initial each change. DO NOT use correction fluid, correcting tape, etc., to make changes, as the voucher will be rejected by DFAS. Invoice amounts can be decreased, but cannot be increased.

+ 3.41.7.1. Distribute approved invoice, Build Invoice screen shot from WINGS, Commander's letter, and SF 1034 as follows:

	+ 3.41.7.1.1. Send the SF 1034, the university invoice and all documentation sent by the university to support the invoice by secure email to tuition.voucher@us.af.mil along with the Build Invoice screen shot from WINGS by the suspense date. Weekends and holidays do count. Detachments should always have a backup to process tuition vouchers in the event the primary tuition NCO is on leave/TDY. NOTE: DO NOT send completed tuition packages directly to DFAS.

	+ 3.41.7.1.2. Ensure the invoice number on the Build Invoice screen from WINGS is the same as the invoice number entered in the Payee's Account Number block on the SF 1034. The invoice number is generated automatically when invoices are created in WINGS. Send a copy of the Build Invoice screen from WINGS to the school so they will be able to identify payment when the EFT is received.

##### 3.41.8.{#3_41_8} Establish and maintain an accounting record file. Use files as a reference to verify the billing, or portion of it, if it has not previously been paid. The file must include voucher number, voucher date, invoices, and supporting documentation.

#### 3.42.{#3_42} Travel Authorization and Allowances.

##### 3.42.1.{#3_42_1} All HSSP scholarship cadets are authorized PCS travel allowance for travel actually performed to activate a scholarship. If a student travels to the detachment with fullintent to activate the scholarship, regardless of whether the scholarship is eventually activated or not, the student is authorized the travel allowance. Reimbursement for such travel may not exceed the distance from selectee's permanent place of residence, school, or duty station at the time of appointment to the institution of enrollment. Prepare a cadet travel order which includes the authority and citation for travel allowances. The student does not need to have the scholarship activated before filing the voucher. Although, HSSP 3-yr Type 2 scholarship winners do not activate the scholarship until becoming a sophomore, they must process applicable travel vouchers upon arrival at the university as a freshman. Do not wait until the cadet activates the scholarship.

##### 3.42.2.{#3_42_2} Detachments must provide selectees residing outside the continental United States (CONUS) with travel orders and instructions on how to use them before their travel date. These orders authorize the cadet to travel via government transportation on a space-A required basis. The cadet may obtain a transportation request from any transportation officer. In the event government transportation is not available, he/she must obtain a statement to that effect from the transportation officer at the port of embarkation or from the United States air attaché in their country. If the travel is performed at the cadet's expense using commercial air (economy class) or commercial ship (minimal first-class accommodation), they may claim reimbursement for the actual cost (travel must be on a United States- flagged carrier). Submit certification of non-availability of government transportation, together with receipts for actual costs of commercial travel, with claims for reimbursement. Selectees traveling to the CONUS by government or commercial carrier may elect to continue travel from the point of arrival in the CONUS to the institution by either commercial or private conveyance.

##### 3.42.3.{#3_42_3} Detachments will assist claimants in filing DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher. The Detachment/CC or designated representative must sign the "Approving Officer Signature" block verifying the information and forward the voucher with three copies of the travel order to the finance office at the support base within 30 calendar days after travel is completed.

##### 3.42.4.{#3_42_4} HSSP scholarship recipients, whose scholarship appointments are later terminated, not including completion of entitlements, are authorized terminal travel allowance from the institution to their home of record. The cadet must disenroll from the institution and actually perform the travel to their home of record. No action is required if the departing cadet does not desire to claim terminal travel allowance.

----

#### 3.43.{#3_43} Scholarship Pre-Activation Actions.

##### 3.43.1.{#3_43_1} Reference Chapter 6 for general enlistment procedures. Detachment/CC should neither enlist selectees nor activate scholarships until the selectee is briefed on military appearance, dress, and grooming standards. In instances where there is an evident lack of motivation, unsuitability for military training, or other sufficient reason to question selectee's entry into AFROTC, withhold scholarship activation pending final determination of suitability. Document the scholarship activation delay on an AFROTC Form 16.

##### 3.43.2.{#3_43_2} Verify the DoDMERB certification is in the cadet's UPRG before the cadet's scholarship is activated.

##### 3.43.3.{#3_43_3} Brief all scholarship selectees that receipt of scholarship funding may affect their eligibility for MGIB benefits after entry onto active duty.

----

#### 3.44.{#3_44} Scholarship Activation Standards.

##### 3.44.1.{#3_44_1} Cadets must meet all AFROTC membership requirements. In addition, the standards below must be met for a selectee to activate a scholarship (except as noted).

##### 3.44.2.{#3_44_2} Scholarship selectees must have a TGPA and a CGPA of 2.50 or higher for scholarship activation (4-year HSSP selectees activating in the fall term of the freshman year are exempt from this requirement). Summer terms (while not funded), will be used in calculating CGPA. TGPA will be the GPA earned in the previous full-time term. Summer term GPAs are not considered when activating scholarships, regardless of how many hours are taken.

##### 3.44.3.{#3_44_3} ICSP selectees must have completed at least one term of full-time, graded college- level work.

##### 3.44.4.{#3_44_4} Must be in good academic standing as defined by the university the cadet is attending. Detachments must verify good academic standing using procedures/criteria established by the university (e.g., academic probation or warning listed on current transcripts, internal links with registrar databases).

##### 3.44.5.{#3_44_5} Scholarship selectees must have a current DoDMERB certification or a waiver approved by HQ AETC/SGPS.

##### 3.44.6.{#3_44_6} Pass the PFA and meet the AFROTC weight/BMI standards. NOTE: 4- Year HSSP cadets contracting during the fall semester are not required to pass the PFA prior to contracting. See Table 3.2.

##### 3.44.7.{#3_44_7} AFOQT. Reference paragraph 4.10 for AFOQT requirements.

##### 3.44.8.{#3_44_8} Cadets unable to activate by last day of term. If the scholarship has not been activated by the last day of the expected activation term, withdraw the offer. For cadets unable to activate due to a pending DoDMERB certification, but who have met all other activation requirements, request a waiver from AFROTC/RRFA. If AFROTC/RRFA grants an extension, then the offer must be activated by the last day of the next term; if not, withdraw the offer. Counsel the cadet via AFROTC Form 16. EXCEPTION: Cadets have until 31 Dec to meet weight / BMI standards. If still failing by 31 Dec, withdraw the offer.

##### 3.44.9.{#3_44_9} In cases where the cadet was unable to activate a scholarship by the last day of the term, HQ AFROTC/RRFA may consider requests for retroactive payment of tuition for the previous term once the scholarship has been activated. Counsel cadets that such approval is not guaranteed, and is at the discretion of HQ AFROTC based on funding constraints, the needs of the Air Force, and the reason for late activation.
